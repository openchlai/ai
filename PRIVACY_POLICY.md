# 🌐 OPENCHS  Privacy & Data Handling Framework  
**(Data Processor-Focused)**

## 1. Privacy Terms & Humanitarian Data Use Addendum

### 📋 Data Collection & Purpose Limitation

As a **Data Processor**, we do not determine the purpose of data collection. Instead:

- We process data **solely under documented instructions** from the Data Controller (e.g., government agency, NGO).
- Data is collected by the Controller, and we ensure its **confidential handling** and lawful processing.
- We never sell personal data or process it beyond the Controller’s mandate.

### 👥 Data Subject Rights (Enabled via Controller)

We support the Controller in enabling data subjects to:

- **Access** their personal data.
- **Correct** inaccurate or outdated data.
- **Delete** data when legally and operationally appropriate.
- **Withdraw consent**, as communicated through the Controller.
- **Object** to certain forms of processing.
