# Accessibility & CRPD Alignment

## Introduction

OpenCHS is committed to ensuring that child helpline services are accessible to all children, including children with disabilities. This document outlines our alignment with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and our approach to accessibility in technology and service delivery.

## Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)

The CRPD, adopted in 2006, establishes that persons with disabilities have the right to full participation in society on an equal basis with others. Children with disabilities face unique vulnerabilities and require special consideration in child protection services.

### Relevant CRPD Articles

**Article 7: Children with Disabilities**
Children with disabilities have the right to express their views freely on all matters affecting them, with disability and age-appropriate assistance.

**Article 9: Accessibility**
States must take appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to information and communications technologies.

**Article 16: Freedom from Exploitation, Violence and Abuse**
Children with disabilities are at higher risk of abuse and require protective measures and accessible reporting mechanisms.

**Article 21: Freedom of Expression and Access to Information**
Persons with disabilities have the right to seek, receive, and impart information on an equal basis with others through accessible means.

## OpenCHS Accessibility Commitments

### Design Philosophy

**Universal Design**: We design services to be usable by all people to the greatest extent possible without adaptation.

**Nothing About Us Without Us**: We involve persons with disabilities in design, testing, and improvement of our systems.
