# Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: OpenCHS (Open Child Helpline System)

**Project Lead**: Nelson Adagi, BITZ IT Consulting LTD

**Funding Partner**: UNICEF Venture Fund

**Primary Location**: Nairobi, Kenya

**Geographic Reach**: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Lesotho (with potential for global expansion)

**Project Type**: Open-source, AI-enhanced child protection technology platform

**License**: GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)

## Vision Statement

To create a globally accessible, AI-powered platform that transforms child helpline services, making professional child protection support available to every child who needs it, regardless of location, language, or resources.

## Mission Statement

OpenCHS empowers child protection organizations with cutting-edge technology to efficiently manage helpline operations, leverage artificial intelligence for improved service delivery, and provide data-driven insights that enhance child safety outcomes across Africa and beyond.

## Project Background

### The Challenge

Child helplines across Africa and developing regions face critical challenges:

- **Limited Resources**: Insufficient counselors to handle call volumes, leading to long wait times and missed calls from children in crisis
- **Language Barriers**: Children speak diverse languages, but helplines often operate in only one or two languages
- **Quality Inconsistency**: Variable counselor training and service quality, with limited quality assurance capacity
- **Data Gaps**: Inadequate systems for tracking cases, measuring impact, and identifying trends
- **Technology Access**: Expensive proprietary systems that drain budgets and create vendor lock-in
- **Scalability**: Difficulty expanding services to reach more children due to infrastructure and cost constraints

### The Solution

OpenCHS addresses these challenges through:

- **AI-Powered Efficiency**: Automated transcription, translation, and case classification to maximize counselor effectiveness
- **Open Source**: Free, transparent technology that organizations can deploy, customize, and improve collaboratively
- **Comprehensive Platform**: Integrated call management, case tracking, quality assurance, and analytics in one system
- **Multi-Language Support**: Real-time translation enabling services in multiple African languages
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analytics and reporting to understand trends, demonstrate impact, and improve services
- **Cloud & On-Premise**: Flexible deployment options to suit different organizational needs and regulations
