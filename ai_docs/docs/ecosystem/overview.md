# Ecosystem Overview

The **openCHS Ecosystem** brings together the **Helpline Service**, the **AI Service**, and connected partner systems into a unified platform for child protection case management.

## Core Components

### 1. Helpline Service
- **Omni-channel communication** (voice, messages, web)
- **Voice-to-text transcription** for accurate case capture
- **Real-time dashboards** to monitor:
  - Location of incidents
  - Perpetrator type
  - Abuse category
  - Resolution time
  - Referral completion
- **Connected referrals** to partner agencies
- **Case lifecycle management** from intake to closure

### 2. AI Service
- **Speech-to-Text + Translation** (Whisper + NLLB)
- **Entity extraction** (names, gender, institutions, locations)
- **Automated classification** (categories, interventions, risks, referrals)
- **Decision support** using risk scores & intervention suggestions
- **Data preparation** for data-driven decision making

### 3. Partner Integrations
- **Government child protection systems** (e.g., CPIMS)
- **Referral partner platforms**
- **Reporting dashboards** for policymakers and stakeholders

## Data Flow
1. **Call or message received** via Helpline Service
2. **AI Service processes** the input (transcribe, translate, classify, extract entities)
3. **Case record created/updated** in openCHS
4. **Connected referrals** sent to partner systems
5. **Monitoring & reporting** through real-time dashboards
