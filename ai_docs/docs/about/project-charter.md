### **Project Scope Document Outline**

#### **1\. Project Overview**

Project Name: AI-Enhanced Child Helpline System

Project Background: 

The AI-Enhanced Child Helpline System project is initiated following the successful award of funding from the Venture Fund, focused on advancing open-source technology solutions to support child protection services. The primary goal is to leverage artificial intelligence to improve the identification and response to cases of Violence Against Children (VAC) and Gender-Based Violence (GBV) during helpline calls. By addressing the critical need for timely and accurate case identification, this project aims to enhance the capacity of child helplines to respond effectively and safeguard vulnerable children.

Project Purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to develop and deploy an integrated AI-driven solution that assists child helpline operators by automating case triage, transcription, and translation. This will enable quicker identification of VAC and GBV cases, reduce response times, and enhance the overall intervention outcomes. The project aligns with UNICEF’s mission to leverage innovative technology to protect children, particularly those in marginalised and underserved communities. By making the solution open-source, the project aims to facilitate broader adoption, enabling similar organisations to benefit from enhanced child protection capabilities.

Key Stakeholders:

1. UNICEF: Providing funding, guidance, and alignment with child protection objectives.  
2. Development Team: Responsible for designing, developing, and testing the AI solution.  
3. Target User Groups: Child helpline operators, case managers, and support staff who will use the AI tool to enhance service delivery.  
4. Child Protection Organizations: Collaborating entities that will help pilot the solution and provide feedback for refinement.  
5. Open-Source Community: Contributors who will support the development, testing, and documentation of the project to ensure its sustainability and scalability.

#### **2\. Project Objectives**

Improve Response to VAC and GBV Cases:

Implement AI-driven tools to assist child helpline operators in accurately identifying cases of Violence Against Children (VAC) and Gender-Based Violence (GBV) during real-time calls.  
Enhance service delivery through automated transcription, translation, and prediction models, leading to faster case triage and more effective interventions.

Enhance Data Management for Child Helplines:

Provide a robust data management system that enables real-time analysis and reporting, helping helplines track cases, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.  
Optimize data processing pipelines to ensure accurate handling of case information, supporting efficient case management.

Foster Collaboration and Data Sharing Among Stakeholders:

Develop and release the solution as an open-source project to encourage widespread adoption and collaboration among child helplines, NGOs, and other stakeholders.  
Facilitate data sharing and integration with existing helpline systems, promoting a unified approach to handling and reporting VAC and GBV cases.

Implement AI for Efficient Case Management:

Leverage AI technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to streamline case assessment, prioritise urgent cases, and provide recommendations for appropriate interventions.  
Continuously refine the AI models based on real-world feedback to improve accuracy and reduce response times.

Provide Real-Time Data Analysis and Reporting Tools:

Integrate real-time data analysis features that allow helpline operators and stakeholders to monitor call statistics, identify emerging patterns, and generate reports on case outcomes.  
Enhance reporting capabilities to provide actionable insights that can guide policy decisions and resource allocation.

#### **11\. Governance and Reporting Structure**

The governance and reporting structure for the project will ensure that the project is properly managed, progress is tracked, and all stakeholders remain informed throughout the project's lifecycle. Below is a suggested structure:

#### Project Management Oversight

The project will be overseen by a Project Steering Committee (or a leadership team) composed of senior stakeholders, project managers, and key subject matter experts. This committee will be responsible for the overall direction of the project, making key decisions, approving changes, and addressing critical issues as they arise.  
Roles in Steering Committee:

* Project Manager (Chairperson)  
* Senior Stakeholders (e.g., representatives from the funding agency, child helpline managers)  
* Legal Advisor  
* AI/ML Lead  
* Data Privacy Officer  
* Child Protection Expert

#### Reporting Cadence

* Weekly Status Updates: A brief meeting with the core project team to review ongoing tasks, milestones, and issues. The Project Manager will provide a summary of the project's current status, highlighting achievements and identifying any risks.  
* Bi-weekly Steering Committee Meetings: These meetings will involve a deeper review of project milestones, budget updates, resource allocation, and risk management. The Project Manager will present a detailed status report, including progress against KPIs, identified risks, and any actions needed from the steering committee. These meetings also allow stakeholders to provide feedback on the direction and strategic adjustments.  
* Monthly Reports: A comprehensive report summarising progress, completed tasks, any deviations from the plan, challenges, and risks encountered. This will be shared with all stakeholders, including external partners, and will contain both qualitative and quantitative metrics.  
* Quarterly Review and Feedback Sessions: These sessions will allow the project team to gather feedback from external stakeholders, including child helplines, end users, and advisors. The focus will be on lessons learned, adjustments needed in the approach, and user feedback on the functionality and effectiveness of the AI systems.

#### Communication Channels

* Project Management Tools: The project team will utilize collaboration and project management tools such as Trello, Jira, or Asana to manage tasks, track progress, and assign responsibilities. These tools will help ensure visibility for all team members and allow easy tracking of milestones, deadlines, and issues.  
* Email and Direct Messaging:  
  * Email will be used for formal communication, updates, and sharing of official documents or reports.  
  * Slack or similar messaging platforms will be used for day-to-day communication, quick queries, and informal updates. Dedicated channels can be set up for different areas of the project (e.g., AI team, legal/ethical considerations, UI/UX feedback).  
* Document Sharing: The team will use cloud-based platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox to store and share documentation, including meeting minutes, technical documentation, design files, and project reports. This ensures that all team members and stakeholders have access to the latest documents.  
* Version Control and Collaboration: The development team will use GitHub or GitLab for version control, enabling collaborative code development and ensuring that all changes are tracked and documented.

#### Risk Management and Issue Resolution

* Risk Review Sessions: Risks will be monitored continuously, with a dedicated session during the bi-weekly steering committee meetings to review existing and new risks. The committee will identify mitigation strategies for identified risks and approve necessary adjustments to the project plan.  
* Issue Escalation Path: If issues arise that cannot be resolved within the team, they will be escalated to the project manager. If further intervention is required, the project manager will raise the issue with the steering committee. For urgent matters, a dedicated meeting will be called to resolve issues as quickly as possible.

#### Key Deliverables and Milestone Reviews

* Milestone Reports: The completion of key milestones will be followed by detailed reporting and reviews with stakeholders. These reviews will focus on:  
  * Deliverables completion  
  * Impact on overall project timeline  
  * Lessons learned and feedback for future phases  
  * Adjustments or additional support needed

#### Decision-Making Process

* Consensus-Based Decision Making: The project will aim for decisions to be made through consensus within the project team and stakeholders. In cases where consensus cannot be reached, the Project Manager, supported by the Steering Committee, will make the final decision.
