### Multi-Channel Support for Case Management

**Current Features**

The system currently supports multiple channels to ensure that individuals can reach out in the way that best suits their situation:

-   **Phone Calls:** Voice calls are a primary method for case intake, enabling individuals to speak directly with case officers or helpline agents. These calls are automatically logged into the system for case creation and follow-up actions.
-   **Web Forms:** Web forms provide a self-service option for individuals to report cases or request updates online. This method is particularly useful for those with internet access, allowing them to submit detailed reports at their convenience.
-   **Social Media:** Social Media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter enable users to report cases and communicate with the helpline team in real-time. These platforms cater to a broader audience, especially the youth and tech-savvy individuals who may prefer using these channels over traditional ones.
-   **In-Person Reports:** In-person submissions at designated service provider offices or partner organizations ensure that individuals without access to digital channels can still report cases. Staff at these locations manually input case details into the system, ensuring no one is left behind.

:::tip Incoming AI-Powered Features
To enhance the system's accessibility and efficiency further, AI-driven upgrades are being introduced to streamline the multi-channel process:

1.  **Automated Case Intake via Social Media:** AI-powered chatbots integrated with social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger will enable instant case intake, allowing users to report issues in real time. These bots will help with initial case triaging and automatically route cases to the appropriate department based on urgency.
2.  **Voice-to-Text Conversion:** OpenAI Whisper will transcribe voice calls in real-time, ensuring accurate documentation of case details without requiring manual input. This will enable more efficient case tracking and resolution.
3.  **AI-Driven Case Routing & Prioritization:** With AI-enhanced case routing, the system will automatically assign cases to the most suitable social worker or service provider, based on the communication channel and urgency level.
4.  **Real-Time Multi-Language Support:** AI will provide automatic language detection and translation for cases submitted through phone, web, or social media channels. This ensures that language barriers do not hinder access to support for individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
