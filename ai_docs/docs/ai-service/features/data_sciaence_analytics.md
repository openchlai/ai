# Data Science & Analytics

## Overview
The **Data Science & Analytics** service processes aggregated case data to uncover patterns, trends, and KPIs.

## Purpose
- Support evidence-based decision-making.
- Identify high-risk areas and populations.
- Evaluate service performance.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Aggregate structured data from case records.
2. **Analytics Engine**:
   - Statistical summaries.
   - Predictive modelling for case volumes.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Dashboards, charts, and geospatial heatmaps.
4. **Reporting**:
   - Export in PDF, Excel, or interactive web formats.

## Input
```json
{
  "cases": [
    { "type": "Neglect", "location": "Kisumu", "date": "2025-06-01" },
    { "type": "Abuse", "location": "Nairobi", "date": "2025-06-03" }
  ]
}
```

## Output
```json
{
  "insights": {
    "total_cases": 2,
    "top_location": "Nairobi",
    "most_common_type": "Abuse"
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib, Plotly for visualization
- Geospatial libraries for mapping

## Human Impact
- **Turns raw case data into clear, actionable intelligence.**
- Helps allocate resources where theyâ€™re needed most.
