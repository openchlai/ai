- **70-79%** - Satisfactory, some areas need attention
- **60-69%** - Below standard, requires coaching
- **Below 60%** - Poor performance, immediate intervention needed

### Completing the Review

**Steps**:
1. Listen to call recording (if available)
2. Review call transcript and case documentation
3. Score each criterion honestly and fairly
4. Calculate section scores
5. Write constructive feedback
6. Save the review
7. Schedule feedback session with counsellor

## Analyzing QA Results

### Individual Performance

**Review Each Counsellor's**:
- **Average scores** across all reviews
- **Trends over time** (improving or declining?)
- **Specific weak areas** (consistently low sections)
- **Strengths** to leverage

**Red Flags**:
- Scores consistently below 70%
- Declining performance trend
- Repeated issues in same area
- Low resolution/counselling scores (safety concern)

### Team Performance

**Aggregate Metrics**:
- Team average QA score
- Common weak areas across staff
- Training needs analysis
- Best performers (for mentoring others)

**Questions to Ask**:
- Are new hires scoring lower? (training issue)
- Are scores lower at certain times? (fatigue, coverage issues)
- Are certain call types poorly handled? (specialized training needed)

### Using QA Data

**For Training**:
- Identify skill gaps
- Design targeted training sessions
- Create coaching plans
- Share best practices

**For Performance Management**:
- Set improvement goals
- Track progress
- Recognize excellence
- Address performance issues

**For Service Improvement**:
- Update protocols based on findings
- Improve scripts and resources
- Adjust staffing based on quality vs. volume
- Enhance supervision

## Providing Feedback

### Scheduling Feedback Sessions

**When to Meet**:
- Within 1 week of completing review
- Regular one-on-ones (monthly minimum)
- Immediately for serious issues
- Group sessions for team-wide patterns

**Meeting Format**:
- 30-45 minutes
- Private, quiet setting
- Have call recording and QA form ready
- Prepare specific examples

### Feedback Best Practices

**Start Positive**:
- Acknowledge strengths
- Highlight what went well
- Specific examples of good practice

**Address Issues Constructively**:
- Describe specific behavior, not personality
- Use "I noticed..." not "You always..."
- Focus on impact on children/service
- Suggest concrete improvements

**Create Action Plan**:
- Agree on 2-3 specific goals
- Set measurable targets
- Schedule follow-up
- Offer support and resources

**Example Feedback**:

**Good**:
> "In the Maria case, you did an excellent job showing empathy when the mother was crying. I noticed you paused and let her express her feelings before asking questions. That's great active listening.
>
> One area to work on: In three calls this month, you didn't ask about immediate safety. Let's practice safety assessment questions. Goal: 100% of calls include safety check by next month. I'll observe your next 5 calls to coach you."

**Bad**:
> "Your scores were low. You need to do better. Be more proactive."

### Handling Difficult Conversations

**If Counsellor Disagrees with Score**:
- Listen to their perspective
- Review specific criteria together
- Explain your reasoning with examples
- Find common ground
- Focus on improvement, not blame

**If Counsellor Is Defensive**:
- Stay calm and professional
- Reiterate goal is to help, not punish
- Acknowledge pressure of the role
- Emphasize teamwork
- Set clear expectations

**If Performance Is Very Poor**:
- Be direct but kind
- Document the conversation
- Create improvement plan with clear deadlines
- Increase supervision
- Follow HR policies for performance management
