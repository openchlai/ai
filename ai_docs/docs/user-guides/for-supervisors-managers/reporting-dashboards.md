# Reporting Dashboards for Supervisors and Managers

Complete guide to understanding analytics, generating reports, and using data for decision-making.

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Accessing the Main Dashboard

![Dashboard Overview](../../images/dashboard-populated.png)

**Navigation**: Click **"Dash"** in the left sidebar

**What You See**: Comprehensive overview of helpline operations including case statistics, call volumes, geographic distribution, and status tracking.

### Dashboard Components

The dashboard has four main sections:

1. **Case Categories** (top left)
2. **Daily Cases** (top right)
3. **Case per Location** (bottom left)
4. **Case Status** (bottom right)

Plus sidebar filters and channel breakdowns.

## Sidebar Controls

### Date Range Selector

**"This Month" Dropdown**:
- Current month (default)
- Last month
- This quarter
- Last quarter
- This year
- Custom date range

**Purpose**: Filter all dashboard data by time period

**Use Cases**:
- Monthly performance reviews
- Quarterly reports
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Campaign period analysis

### View Type Selector

**"Both VAC & GBV" Dropdown**:
- Both VAC & GBV (show all cases)
- VAC only (Violence Against Children)

## Case Categories Section

### Visual Display

**Pie Chart** shows distribution of case types:
- Green: Non-Interventions (313 cases - 89%)
- Light Green: Information Inquiry (34 cases - 10%)
- Blue: Abuse & Violence (2 cases)
- Purple: Counselling (2 cases)

### Data Table

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Non-Interventions | 313 | ~89% |
| Information Inquiry | 34 | ~10% |
| Abuse & Violence | 2 | <1% |
| Counselling | 2 | <1% |
| **Total** | **351** | **100%** |

### Understanding the Categories

**Non-Interventions** (Highest Volume):
- General information requests
- Directory assistance
- Brief consultations
- Does not require case creation typically
- High volume is normal

**Information Inquiry**:
- Specific questions about services
- Eligibility inquiries
- Referral requests
- Educational questions

**Abuse & Violence** (Critical Priority):
- Physical abuse
- Sexual abuse
- Emotional abuse
- Domestic violence
- **Always high priority regardless of count**

**Counselling**:
- Mental health support
- Crisis counseling
- Emotional support
- Therapeutic intervention

### Using This Data

**For Staffing**:
- High non-intervention volumes suggest need for FAQ resources
- Can some be handled by chatbot or automated systems?
- Allows counsellors to focus on serious cases

**For Training**:
- Are serious cases (abuse, violence) being properly categorized?
- Do staff need more training on identification?
- Review sample cases from each category

**For Reporting**:
- Track month-over-month category trends
- Identify emerging patterns
- Report VAC/GBV rates to stakeholders

## Daily Cases Section

### Time Series Chart

**Displays**: Number of cases handled each day over the selected period

**Y-Axis**: Case count (0 to max, e.g., 350)
**X-Axis**: Dates (1 Oct 2025 to 1 Oct 2025 in example)

### Data Table

Shows daily breakdown by channel:

| Date | Call | Walk-in | Total |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| 1 Oct 2025 | 350 | 1 | **351** |

### What to Look For

**Patterns**:
- Which days have highest volume?
- Are weekends different from weekdays?
- Are there seasonal patterns?
- Do campaigns drive spikes?

**Trends**:
- Increasing or decreasing over time?
- Consistent volume or erratic?
- Impact of staffing changes?

**Anomalies**:
- Sudden spikes (investigate cause)
- Unexpected drops (system issues? Staffing?)
- Zero-case days (holiday? Outage?)

### Using This Data

**For Capacity Planning**:
- Schedule more staff on high-volume days
- Plan training on low-volume days
- Anticipate seasonal fluctuations

**For Goal Setting**:
- Target number of cases to handle
- Growth projections
- Service expansion planning

## Case per Location Section

### Geographic Distribution

**Pie Chart** shows where cases originate:
- Blue (largest): (blank) - 308 cases
- Various colors: Named locations
  - Nairobi: 4 cases
  - Nakuru: 4 cases
  - Kakamega: 3 cases
  - Kiambu: 3 cases
  - Makueni: 3 cases
  - Tharaka-Nithi: 3 cases
  - (and more)

### Data Table

| Location | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| (blank) | 308 | ~88% |
| Nairobi | 4 | ~1% |
| Nakuru | 4 | ~1% |
| Other locations | 3 each | <1% each |
| **Total** | **351** | **100%** |

### Understanding "Blank" Locations

**Why So Many Blanks?**:
- Location not captured during call
- Caller refused to provide
- Quick information calls (didn't ask)
- System field left empty

**Action Items**:
- Train staff to always ask for location
- Make location field required
- Add "Refused" option vs leaving blank
- Improve data collection protocols

### Using Location Data

**For Service Planning**:
- Identify underserved areas
- Plan outreach in high-need regions
- Partner with local organizations in hotspots

**For Resource Allocation**:
- Referral networks by location
- Translation needs by region
- Cultural competency training

**For Stakeholder Reporting**:
- Show geographic reach
- Demonstrate community impact
- Support funding requests for specific regions

## Case Status Section

### Status Indicators

**Closed Cases** (Green Bar): 250
- Cases successfully resolved
- Highest volume (good sign!)

**Pending Cases** (Orange Bar): 5
- Cases in progress
- Awaiting information or follow-up

**Escalated Cases** (Gray Bar): 0
- Cases requiring specialized intervention
- Transferred to higher-level support

### Priority Distribution

Shows case urgency levels:

**Low Priority**: 340
- Non-urgent matters
- Standard follow-up schedule
- Most cases fall here (expected)

**Medium Priority**: 6
- Requires attention within 48-72 hours
- Moderate concern
- Monitor closely

**High Priority**: 3
- Immediate intervention needed
- Emergency situations
- **Requires supervisor oversight**

**Total**: 351

### Health Indicators

**Healthy Status Distribution**:
- High % closed (250/351 = 71%)
- Low pending count (5)
- Zero escalations
- Few high-priority (3)

**Concerning Patterns**:
- Growing pending backlog
- Many escalations (capacity issue?)
- Too many high-priority (identification problem?)
- Low closure rate

### Using Status Data

**Daily Monitoring**:
- Check pending cases every morning
- Follow up on high-priority immediately
- Ensure escalated cases being handled

**Performance Tracking**:
- Closure rate (target: >70%)
- Average time to close
- Escalation rate (target: <5%)
- Priority accuracy

**Resource Allocation**:
- Assign experienced staff to high-priority
- Balance caseload across team
- Identify need for additional resources
