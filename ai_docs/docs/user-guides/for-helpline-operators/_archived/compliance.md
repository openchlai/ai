# Compliance & Data Protection Guidelines

We are committed to upholding the highest standards of compliance, child safeguarding, and data protection in all aspects of our AI-enabled Child Helpline System.

Our system handles sensitive personal and case-related data, including information processed by AI models. Therefore, we follow strict legal, ethical, and technical safeguards to ensure privacy, security, and responsible AI use.

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance

### Data Protection Laws
We operate in compliance with:
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019**
- Relevant **child protection and privacy legislation** in each jurisdiction where the helpline operates.

This includes ensuring:
- **Lawful basis** for collecting and processing personal data.
- **Explicit consent** where required.
- **Rights of data subjects**, including access, correction, and deletion.

## Confidentiality Protocols

- **Operator Confidentiality**: All human operators are bound by confidentiality agreements and undergo background checks and child safeguarding training.
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions ensure that only authorized personnel can access case information.
- **Data Minimization**: Only data strictly necessary for case handling is collected and retained.

---

## AI Model Governance

- **Model Transparency**: All AI models are documented with details on their purpose, capabilities, limitations, and data sources used for training.
- **Bias & Fairness Checks**: Models are regularly tested for bias, ensuring they do not disadvantage or misinterpret vulnerable groups.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI is used to assist, not replace, trained human operators—especially for high-risk or complex cases.
- **Explainability**: Where AI recommendations or insights are provided, operators are able to view reasoning or evidence to make informed decisions.

---

## Data Security

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Secure Infrastructure**: Systems are hosted on secure, monitored environments with regular security audits.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: All data access and modifications are logged for accountability.

---

## Mandatory Reporting

We have a **legal and ethical obligation** to report any suspected cases of:
- Child abuse
- Neglect
- Exploitation
- Any other threats to child safety

Reports are made promptly to the **appropriate authorities** according to established national and international reporting protocols.

---

## Data Retention & Disposal

- Case data is retained only for as long as necessary for safeguarding, legal compliance, and service improvement.
- Upon expiry of the retention period, all data is **securely deleted** or **anonymized** for statistical and research purposes.

---

## Continuous Compliance

We conduct **regular audits** and **staff training** to ensure ongoing compliance with all relevant data protection and child safeguarding requirements. AI models are periodically reviewed for alignment with ethical AI standards and legal frameworks.

**By integrating robust compliance protocols with advanced AI assistance, our helpline ensures that children’s voices are heard, their rights are protected, and their data is handled with the utmost care.**
