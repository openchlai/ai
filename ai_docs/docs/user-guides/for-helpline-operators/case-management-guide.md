# Case Management Guide for Helpline Operators

Complete guide to creating, documenting, and managing cases from first contact through resolution.

## Understanding Cases

### What is a Case?

A **case** is an official record of any incident or interaction that requires intervention, follow-up, or documentation beyond a simple information inquiry.

**Case Components**:
- **Reporter**: Person reporting the issue
- **Client(s)**: Child or person receiving help
- **Perpetrator(s)**: Person causing harm (if applicable)
- **Case Details**: Narrative, category, priority
- **Activities**: All actions taken on the case
- **Files**: Supporting documents or evidence

### When to Create a Case

✅ **Create a Case For**:
- Child protection concerns
- Abuse or violence (physical, sexual, emotional)
- Neglect situations
- Mental health crises
- Situations requiring follow-up
- Referrals to other services
- Any VAC (Violence Against Children) or GBV (Gender-Based Violence)

❌ **Don't Create a Case For**:
- General information requests
- Wrong numbers
- Prank calls
- Simple directory assistance

**Rule of Thumb**: When in doubt, create the case. It's better to document than miss something important.

## Creating a Walk-In Case

### Step 1: Register the Walk-In

![Walk-In Button](../../images/helpline-dashboard.png)

1. Click **"Walk In"** button (green, top right of screen)
2. Navigate to **"Activities"** tab
3. Click **"New Reporter"**

### Step 2: Enter Reporter Information

![New Reporter Form](../../images/helpline-new-reporter.png)

**Required Fields** (marked with *):
- **Name**: Full name of person reporting
- **Age** or **Date of Birth** or **Age Group**: Their age information
- **Location**: Where they're from (dropdown)
- **Sex**: Male/Female (dropdown)

**Optional but Recommended**:
- **Nearest Landmark**: Helps locate them
- **Nationality**: Country of origin
- **Phone Number**: Primary contact
- **Alternative Phone**: Backup contact
- **Email**: If they have one

**Tips**:
- Use clear, correct spelling for names
- Double-check phone numbers
- Ask for landmark details - helps follow-up

Click **"Create"** when complete.

### Step 3: Create the Case

![Case Form](../../images/helpline-case-form.png)

After creating reporter, system shows case form:

**Reporter Section**:
- ✅ Check "Reporter is also a Client" if the person reporting is the victim/client themselves
- Otherwise, you'll add client separately

**Required Case Information**:

1. **Case Category*** (dropdown)
   - Non-Interventions
   - Information Inquiry
   - Abuse & Violence
   - Counselling
   - Mental Health
   - (Other categories based on your helpline's setup)

2. **Is this Case GBV Related?*** (radio buttons)
   - Yes / No
   - GBV = Gender-Based Violence

3. **Case Narrative*** (text area)
   - Write detailed description of the situation
   - Include: What happened, when, who's involved, current status
   - Be objective - record facts, not opinions
   - Include caller's own words when important

4. **Case Plan** (text area)
   - What actions will be taken
   - Referrals needed
   - Follow-up schedule
   - Expected outcomes

### Step 4: Add Client Information

If reporter is NOT the client:

1. Click **"Add a Client"**
2. Fill in client details:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Sex
   - Location
   - Contact information (if available)
   - Relationship to reporter

**For Child Protection Cases**: Always add the child as a client, even if parent is reporting.

### Step 5: Add Perpetrator (If Applicable)

If there's an identified perpetrator:

1. Click **"Add a Perpetrator"**
2. Fill in available information:
   - Name (if known)
   - Relationship to client
   - Any identifying details
   - Location

**Safety Note**: Only record information you have. Never guess or make assumptions.

### Step 6: Attach Files

If you have supporting documents:

1. Click **"Attach a File"**
2. Choose file from your computer
3. Upload (photos, documents, reports, etc.)

**Privacy**: Ensure all files are properly secured and only contain necessary information.

### Step 7: Complete Additional Sections

**Services Offered** (dropdown):
- Select what services you're providing or referring
- Can select multiple

**How did you know about 116?** (dropdown):
- Track how clients learn about helpline
- Helps with outreach planning

### Step 8: Save the Case

1. Review all required fields (marked with *)
2. Check information for accuracy
3. Click **"Save"** or **"Submit"** (bottom of form)
4. Note your **Case ID** number

**Case ID**: Every case gets a unique ID (e.g., "KE-CHL-2025-001234"). Write this down - you'll need it for follow-ups.

## Creating a Phone Call Case

### During or After the Call

If call needs a case:

1. Click **"New Case"** button
2. System **auto-populates**:
   - Source: "call"
   - Source UID: Call identifier
   - Reporter phone number
   - Date/time

3. **Complete remaining information** (same as walk-in steps above)

**Advantage**: Phone cases automatically link to call records, making tracking easier.

## Managing Existing Cases

### Finding a Case

**Method 1: Cases List**

## Documentation Best Practices

### Writing Case Narratives

**Good Example**:
> "Mother reports 12-year-old daughter Maria has been withdrawn for 3 weeks. Maria stopped attending school on Sept 15. Mother states Maria cries frequently and refuses to talk about what's wrong. Family lives in Kibera. No known history of abuse. Mother requests counseling referral."

**Poor Example**:
> "Mom called about sad kid. Needs help."

**Key Principles**:
- **Be specific**: Include names, ages, dates, locations
- **Be objective**: Record facts, not interpretations
- **Be complete**: Answer who, what, when, where, why
- **Be professional**: Use proper language, check spelling
- **Be confidential**: Only record relevant information

### Using Proper Language

**DO Use**:
- "Client reports..."
- "Mother states..."
- "Child disclosed..."
- "Visible injuries observed..."

**DON'T Use**:
- "I think..."
- "Maybe..."
- "Probably..."
- Personal judgments

### Protecting Privacy

**Always**:
- Use system's secure storage
- Only share with authorized personnel
- Redact unnecessary identifying details in reports
- Follow data protection policies

**Never**:
- Discuss cases outside work
- Share client information on personal devices
- Leave case files open on shared computers
- Email case details without encryption

## Referrals and Follow-Ups

### Making Referrals

When client needs external services:

1. **Identify appropriate service**:
   - Police (criminal matters)
   - Hospital (medical care)
   - Mental health clinic
   - Legal aid
   - Shelter/safe house

2. **Document referral in case**:
   - Where referred
   - Contact person
   - Date of referral
   - Referral reason

3. **Follow up**:
   - Confirm client received service
   - Document outcome
   - Adjust case plan if needed

### Scheduling Follow-Ups

**To Schedule**:
1. Open the case
2. Click **"Add Activity"**
3. Select **"Follow-up"** type
4. Set date and time
5. Add reminder note
6. Save

**System will alert you** when follow-up is due.

**Follow-Up Checklist**:
- Has situation improved?
- Were referrals successful?
- Does client need additional support?
- Update case status
- Schedule next follow-up if needed

## Working with Different Case Types

### Abuse & Violence Cases

**Extra Precautions**:
- Document everything in detail
- Note exact words used
- Record visible injuries
- Assess immediate safety
- Follow mandatory reporting laws
- Contact supervisor if unsure

### Mental Health Cases

**Key Actions**:
- Assess immediate risk (self-harm, suicide)
- Use mental health screening tools (if trained)
- Provide crisis counseling  numbers
- Refer to psychiatric services
- Schedule quick follow-up (24-48 hours)

### Information Inquiry

**Quick Cases**:
- May not need full case documentation
- Record as disposition instead
- Create case if follow-up needed
- Provide accurate information
- Note what information was given

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Incomplete Information

**Problem**: Caller won't or can't provide full details

**Solution**:
- Record what you have
- Note what's missing
- Set follow-up to gather more information
- Use "Unknown" or "Not Disclosed" fields
- Don't make up information

### Challenge 2: Multiple Issues in One Call

**Problem**: Caller reports several different problems

**Solution**:
- Prioritize by severity
- May need multiple cases
- Link related cases together
- Address immediate crisis first
- Schedule follow-ups for other issues

### Challenge 3: Language Barriers

**Problem**: Can't understand caller

**Solution**:
- Use translation features
- Find colleague who speaks language
- Use simple words and gestures (walk-ins)
- Document language used
- Arrange interpreter for follow-up

### Challenge 4: Emotional Callers

**Problem**: Caller too distressed to provide information

**Solution**:
- Allow time to calm down
- Focus on immediate safety first
- Get basic information only
- Schedule callback when caller is calmer
- Document emotional state
