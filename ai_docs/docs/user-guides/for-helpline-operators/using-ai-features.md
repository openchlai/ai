# Using AI Features - Operator Guide

Learn how AI-powered features assist you in handling calls and managing cases more effectively.

## What AI Does for You

openCHS uses artificial intelligence to help you work more efficiently and accurately. The AI works **in the background** - you don't need to operate it manually.

### AI Features Overview

| Feature | What It Does | How It Helps You |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Speech-to-Text** | Converts call audio to text | Automatic transcripts of conversations |
| **Translation** | Translates between languages | Understand calls in Swahili, English, and other languages |
| **Case Classification** | Suggests case type and priority | Helps identify VAC/GBV cases faster |
| **Smart Summaries** | Creates concise case summaries | Saves time on documentation |
| **Entity Extraction** | Finds names, locations, ages | Captures key details automatically |

**Important**: AI assists you - it doesn't replace your judgment. You always make the final decisions.

## Speech-to-Text Transcription

### How It Works

When someone calls:
1. AI **listens** to the conversation
2. **Converts speech to text** in real-time
3. **Displays transcript** on your screen
4. You **review and edit** as needed

### What You See

During a call, a transcription panel shows:
- What the caller is saying
- Your responses
- Timestamps
- Speaker identification (Caller vs. Operator)

**Example**:
```
[10:15 AM] Caller: "Mimi ni mama. Mtoto wangu ana umri wa miaka 12..."
[10:15 AM] Operator: "Samahani, naweza kusaidia. Je, mtoto yuko salama sasa?"
```

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Don't miss details** - Transcript captures everything  
‚úÖ **Focus on listening** - Don't worry about writing everything down  
‚úÖ **Accurate records** - Exact words are documented  
‚úÖ **Review later** - Go back to what was said  

### Your Role

**During the Call**:
- Listen actively to the caller
- Let AI handle transcription
- Take brief notes only when needed
- Focus on building rapport

**After the Call**:
- Review the transcript
- Correct any errors or misheard words
- Add context that AI might miss
- Save cleaned-up version with case

### Limitations

AI transcription is good but not perfect:
- May mishear names or unfamiliar words
- Struggles with heavy accents
- Can't capture tone of voice
- Doesn't understand context or emotions

**Always review transcripts before finalizing cases.**

## Language Translation

### How It Works

AI can translate conversations in real-time:

**Swahili ‚Üí English**:
- Caller speaks Swahili
- You see English translation
- You respond in English
- Caller hears Swahili (if using translation feature)

**Supports**:
- Swahili
- English
- Other languages (depending on your helpline setup)

### When Translation Helps

**Scenario 1**: Caller Speaks Only Swahili
- AI translates their words to English for you
- You can respond in English
- AI translates back to Swahili

**Scenario 2**: Mixed Language Conversation
- Some words in Swahili, some in English
- AI identifies and translates appropriately
- You see clean, understandable text

**Scenario 3**: Documentation
- Call was in Swahili
- Case report needs to be in English
- AI provides English translation for records

### Using Translation

**What You Do**:
1. Handle the call normally
2. AI automatically detects language
3. Translation appears on screen
4. You read translated text
5. Respond naturally

**What You Don't Need to Do**:
- Press any translation buttons
- Select languages manually (AI detects)
- Worry about grammar - AI handles it

### Translation Quality

**Generally Accurate For**:
- Common phrases and words
- Standard conversations
- General topics

**May Struggle With**:
- Regional dialects
- Slang or colloquialisms
- Technical or medical terms
- Cultural expressions

**Your Expertise Matters**: If translation seems off, trust your knowledge. You can override or clarify.

## Case Classification

### How It Works

As you enter case information, AI analyzes the details and suggests:
- **Case Category** (Abuse, Mental Health, Information, etc.)
- **Priority Level** (Low, Medium, High)
- **GBV Classification** (Yes/No)

### What AI Looks For

**Indicators of High Priority**:
- Words like "immediate," "emergency," "danger"
- References to injuries or threats
- Young child ages (under 10)
- Specific abuse descriptions

**Indicators of Case Type**:
- Keywords: "hit," "hurt" ‚Üí Physical abuse
- Keywords: "touched," "inappropriate" ‚Üí Sexual abuse
- Keywords: "alone," "hungry," "dirty" ‚Üí Neglect
- Keywords: "sad," "crying," "won't eat" ‚Üí Mental health

### Using AI Suggestions

**When AI Suggests a Category**:

1. **Review the suggestion**
   - Read AI's reasoning
   - Consider if it matches your understanding

2. **Accept or Override**
   - ‚úÖ Accept if accurate
   - ‚úèÔ∏è Change if you disagree
   - üí≠ Ask supervisor if unsure

3. **Document your decision**
   - Add note explaining why you agreed or disagreed
   - Builds better AI over time

**Example**:
```
AI Suggests: High Priority - Physical Abuse
Your Assessment: Agree ‚úì
Reason: Clear indicators of immediate harm
```

### When to Override AI

**Override If**:
- You have information AI didn't consider
- Cultural context changes meaning
- Caller's tone indicates different severity
- Your training tells you something else
- You know the case history

**You Are Always Right**: Trust your judgment. AI assists, you decide.

## Smart Summaries

### How It Works

After a call or when you save a case, AI generates:
- **Brief summary** (2-3 sentences)
- **Key points** extracted
- **Action items** identified

### Example Summary

**Your Detailed Notes**:
> Mother called at 10:15 AM stating 12-year-old daughter Maria has not been going to school for past 3 weeks. Maria cries frequently, refuses to eat properly, stays in room all day. Mother very worried. No known abuse. Family lives in Kibera. Father works away from home. Mother requests counseling help for daughter. Says Maria used to be happy child, good student. Change started suddenly 3 weeks ago after school trip.

**AI Summary**:
> 12-year-old girl (Maria) experiencing sudden behavioral changes: school refusal, crying, appetite loss, social withdrawal for 3 weeks. No abuse history. Mother requests mental health counseling. Possible depression requiring psychiatric evaluation.

### Benefits

‚úÖ Quick overview of complex cases  
‚úÖ Easy handover to other staff  
‚úÖ Fast case review for supervisors  
‚úÖ Consistent documentation format  

### Using Summaries

**When to Use**:
- Quick case handovers

## Entity Extraction

### What Are Entities?

**Entities** are important pieces of information AI automatically finds:

**Types of Entities**:
- **People**: Names (Maria, John, Sarah)
- **Locations**: Places (Kibera, Nairobi, Hospital)
- **Ages**: Numbers (12 years old, teenager)
- **Organizations**: Services (Police, Hospital, School)
- **Dates/Times**: When things happened

### How It Helps

**Before AI**:
- You manually search through notes for names
- Might miss important details
- Inconsistent recording

**With AI**:
- Key information highlighted
- Auto-fills case form fields
- Creates quick reference list

### Example

**From Transcript**:
> "My name is Sarah and I'm calling about my daughter Maria who is 12 years old. We live in Kibera near the market. She hasn't been to Westside School in three weeks."

**AI Extracts**:
- **Reporter**: Sarah (Mother)
- **Client**: Maria (12 years old, Female)
- **Location**: Kibera
- **Organization**: Westside School
- **Duration**: 3 weeks

### Your Role

**Review Extracted Information**:
- Check if AI got names right
- Verify ages and locations
- Correct any mistakes
- Add missing context

**Common AI Mistakes**:
- Confusing similar-sounding names
- Getting relationship wrong (is Sarah the mother or aunt?)
- Missing cultural name variations
- Incorrect age if not clearly stated

## AI Limitations - What It Can't Do

### AI Cannot

‚ùå **Replace your empathy** - Only you can comfort distressed callers
