## 2. Objective & Hypothesis

### Problem Statement

Case workers at child helplines manually review conversation transcripts to extract critical information including:
- **Person Information:** All the available names in the transcript, ages and gendergenders
- **Location Data:** Geographic locations and landmarks for referral routing
- **Incident Details:** Types of issues/crises being reported
- **Contact Information:** Phone numbers for follow-up

This manual extraction process is:
- **Time-consuming:** 5-10 minutes per call for documentation
- **Error-prone:** Inconsistent data entry and missed information
- **Unscalable:** Cannot keep pace with call volume
- **Inefficient:** Delays case processing and referral routing

An effective NER model can automate this extraction, enabling faster case processing, consistent data collection, and better analytical insights.

### Hypothesis

**By fine-tuning a `distilbert-base-cased` model on a synthetic dataset of helpline conversations, we can achieve an F1-score exceeding 75% for identifying key entities, thereby significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of information extraction.**

The hypothesis was based on:
1. DistilBERT's proven effectiveness for token classification tasks
2. Domain-specific fine-tuning's ability to adapt to specialized vocabulary
3. Synthetic data's potential to provide diverse, consistent training examples 

### Success Criteria

**Primary Metric:**
-  Overall Micro F1-Score > 0.75 â†’ **Achieved: 0.985**

**Secondary Metrics:**
-  Per-entity F1-Score for NAME > 0.80 â†’ **Achieved: 0.79-0.83**
-  Per-entity F1-Score for all other entities > 0.60 â†’ **Achieved: 0.60-0.77**
-  Overall model accuracy > 0.90 â†’ **Achieved: 0.987**

**Qualitative Goals:**
-  Correctly identifies names
-  Identify locations and incident types from conversational context
-  Handle rare entities (LANDMARK, PHONE_NUMBER) - needs improvement

## 7. Challenges & Limitations

### Dataset Limitations

1. **Synthetic Data Constraints:**
   -  **Strength:** Enabled rapid prototyping without privacy concerns
   -  **Limitation:** May lack full complexity and noise of real conversations
   - **Risk:** Model may struggle with edge cases not represented in synthetic data
   - **Mitigation:** Plan real-world data integration for next iteration

2. **Class Imbalance:**
   - **Severe imbalance:** NAME (6,549) vs PHONE_NUMBER (60) = 109:1 ratio
   - **Impact:** Model biased toward frequent classes
   - **Evidence:** Complete failure on LANDMARK and PHONE_NUMBER
   - **Mitigation Options:**
     - Data augmentation for rare classes
     - Class weighting in loss function
     - Oversampling minority classes

3. **Entity Definition Ambiguity:**
   - **INCIDENT_TYPE:** Broad category with high variability
     - Examples: "child labor", "neglect", "abuse", "parental conflicts"
     - Variable phrasing makes consistent recognition difficult
   - **LOCATION:** Generic terms ("home", "school") vs specific ("Mtwara")
   - **Recommendation:** Refine annotation guidelines with clearer boundaries

### Model Limitations

1. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - DistilBERT has **6 transformer layers** (vs BERT's 12)
   - May have limited capacity for deep contextual reasoning
   - **Evidence:** Low performance on INCIDENT_TYPE (requires situational context)
   - **Alternative:** Consider BERT-base or RoBERTa-base for complex entities

2. **Rare Entity Recognition:**
   - Standard fine-tuning insufficient for rare classes (<500 examples)
   - Model learns to predict frequent classes and ignores rare ones
   - **Alternative Approaches:**
     - Few-shot learning techniques
     - Meta-learning for rare entity adaptation
     - Hierarchical classification (coarseâ†’fine entity types)

3. **Sequence Length Constraints:**
   - **Max length:** 512 tokens (DistilBERT limit)
   - **Issue:** Longer conversations truncated, potentially losing entities
   - **Impact:** Unknown (not measured in this experiment)
   - **Mitigation:** Sliding window or hierarchical attention for long documents

4. **Multilingual data:** This model performs poorly on multilingual data, but it could do better if finetuned with language specific data

### Operational Limitations

1. **Domain Shift Risk:**
   - Trained on synthetic English conversations
   - **Risk:** Real-world accents, dialects, noise, code-switching may degrade performance
   - **Plan:** Continuous monitoring with real-world data; periodic retraining

2. **Ethical Considerations:**
   - **Privacy:** Model trained on synthetic data; no real PII risk
   - **Bias:** May reflect biases in synthetic data generation
   - **Fairness:** Performance across demographics not evaluated
   - **Action:** Conduct fairness audit before production deployment

3. **Error Propagation:**

## 10. Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **More Balanced Data Collection:**
   - Ensure minimum 500 examples per entity type from the start
   - Use stratified sampling to maintain class balance
   - **Impact:** Would have prevented LANDMARK/PHONE_NUMBER failures

2. **Iterative Entity Definition:**
   - Start with coarse entity types (PERSON, PLACE, EVENT)
   - Refine to fine-grained types based on initial model feedback
   - **Impact:** INCIDENT_TYPE might perform better with hierarchical approach

3. **Earlier Real-World Validation:**
   - Collect 100-200 real transcripts for dev/test early on
   - Use synthetic data for training, real data for validation
   - **Impact:** Earlier detection of domain shift issues

4. **Annotation Quality:**
   - Use clear, unambiguous annotation guidelines
   - Conduct inter-annotator agreement checks (Îº > 0.80)
   - Regular calibration sessions for annotators

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Start with efficient models (DistilBERT) for fast iteration
   - Scale to larger models only if necessary
   - Balance accuracy vs inference time for production

6. **Evaluation Strategy:**
   - Report per-entity metrics, not just overall scores
   - Use confusion matrices to identify systematic errors
   - Qualitative error analysis is as important as quantitative metrics

7. **Deployment Planning:**
   - Always include human-in-the-loop for initial deployment
   - Set confidence thresholds based on risk tolerance
   - Monitor production performance continuously
