Lately, there have been some difficult situations at home due to parental conflicts that escalated into a divorce and custody disputes. The tension is affecting her greatly. I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, Peace. It's crucial we find ways to help Nen cope with the changes happening in her life. Can you tell me more about how she's been handling things? Has she been expressing any feelings or exhibiting any unusual behavior? Since the divorce proceedings began, I've noticed that Nen has become quieter and more withdrawn. She used to be outgoing and social but now she prefers to spend most of her time alone. She's also been having trouble sleeping and frequently wakes up in tears. It breaks my heart to see her like this. I understand how hard this must be for you, Peace. It's important to remember that it's okay for Nen to feel upset and confused during this time. I recommend engaging a therapist who specializes in child psychology to help guide both Nen and yourself through these challenging moments. Mwakamba, thank you for listening. I appreciate your advice and will look into finding a therapist as soon as possible. Do you have any recommendations on how to find one in Singida? I'm glad that you're seeking help for Nen, Peace.

There's a 7-year-old boy named Asani who lives with us and I've noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He seems withdrawn, less energetic than usual, and often cries for no apparent reason. That sounds concerning, Azizi. It's great that you've reached out for help. Has Asani experienced any major life changes or stressors lately? For example, moving homes, a family member passing away, or a change in school? Unfortunately, yes. We recently lost his grandfather, who was like a father figure to him. Since the funeral, I believe his grief has been overwhelming for him. He's also started a new school and is having trouble adjusting. I see. It's normal for a child to experience sadness after losing someone close, but it does sound like Asani might be struggling more than usual. Would you consider reaching out to a local grief counselor or psychologist who specializes in helping children cope with loss? They can provide additional support and guidance during this difficult time. That's a good idea. I will look into finding a professional that can help him. Thank you for your advice, Saida.

He also seems fearful, as if there's something weighing heavily on his mind.

The man seemed to be offering him a job in the city, promising better opportunities. Hamisi agreed without hesitation, which worried me greatly.

{"text": "Hello, is this the child helpline? Yes, I'm here to help. My name is Mohamed, how can I assist you today? I'm Eliana from Magharibi Unguja, Mjini Magharibi, and I'm 16 years old. I have a question about my dietary needs as I've recently been diagnosed with celiac disease. I'm unsure of what foods I can eat safely without causing any harm to my health. I understand your situation, Eliana. Celiac disease can be challenging to manage, especially when it comes to food. It's important to ensure you're getting the nutrients you need while avoiding gluten. Can you tell me more about what you typically eat and if you've already made any changes to your diet? I'd be happy to help guide you towards safe and healthy food choices. I usually eat rice, beans, fish, and vegetables for my meals, but I'm not sure if they are safe for me now. My mother has started preparing separate meals for me, which includes a lot of gluten-free grains like quinoa and millet. But, I'm still worried about unintentional contamination from cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods. It's great that your mother is being proactive in preparing separate meals for you, Eliana. However, it's important to ensure that there is no cross-contamination in the kitchen to prevent accidental consumption of gluten. I would recommend using separate utensils, cutting boards, and cooking surfaces for gluten-free foods to minimize any risk of contamination. Additionally, it might be helpful to educate your family members about celiac disease and its importance to maintain a strict gluten-free diet.

Let's talk more about what's been happening with Idi. Can you tell me a bit more about the situation? What kind of friendship issues is he facing? Well, it appears that Idi is being excluded by some of his peers. He mentioned that they don't let him play during recess and sometimes make fun of him when they do interact. This has been going on for a few weeks now. I'm really sorry to hear that. Exclusion can be very distressing for a child, especially at such a young age.

He seems to be going through something and I'm worried. Can you help me understand what he might be experiencing? Oh, Sabina, it's important that we talk about this. It sounds like Jacob may be dealing with depression. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior or mood recently? Yes, I have. He used to be a cheerful and active child, but lately, he's been withdrawn and seems sad most of the time. He doesn't play as much as he used to, and even when we try to engage him in activities, he often refuses. I'm sorry to hear that, Sabina. It's possible that Jacob is experiencing depression, especially if there are no significant life events that could explain his sudden change in behavior. Depression can sometimes be a result of biological predisposition or chemical imbalances in the brain. That makes sense. I've also noticed that he doesn't seem to enjoy things he used to like anymore. He rarely smiles and when he does, it doesn't reach his eyes. Is this a common symptom? Yes, lack of enthusiasm for previously enjoyed activities is indeed a common symptom of depression in children. It's also important to note that changes in appetite or sleep patterns, frequent crying, low self-esteem, and difficulty concentrating can also be signs. Thank you, Josphat.

Recently, I noticed she's been skipping school frequently and her behavior has become erratic. When I spoke to her, she mentioned working long hours at a local shop after school. This doesn't seem right as she should be focusing on her education. She appears tired, stressed, and anxious most of the time.

I believe she might be involved in child labor or exploitative employment. Can you help me understand what steps I can take next? I want to ensure Hanifa receives the assistance she needs and that her rights are protected. I appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time. Thank you. [Samira's response] I understand your concern, Asma. It's crucial to protect children from exploitation. The situation you've described may indeed be child labor, which is illegal in Tanzania. I commend you for reaching out for help. Firstly, it's important to gather more evidence about Hanifa's employment. If possible, document the shop where she works, the hours she spends there, and any other details that could support your claims. Secondly, I recommend speaking to local authorities or organizations specializing in child rights and protection. They can provide guidance on reporting child labor cases and offer resources for Hanifa's well-being. Lastly, it might be helpful to involve Hanifa's school teachers.

I don't know what to do or how to make it stop. I'm really sorry to hear that Modesta. It sounds like you're going through a tough time. Fighting between parents can be overwhelming for children, especially when it affects the home environment. Can you tell me more about what's been happening between your parents? Have they been arguing over something specific or is it more general stress? It's mostly over work and money. My dad has a small business, but it hasn't been doing well recently, and my mom is stressed because of the bills. They argue almost every night, and I can hear them yelling from my room. It's making it hard for me to sleep at night. I understand how difficult that must be for you Modesta. It's important to remember that it's not your fault what's happening between your parents. Sometimes adults have their own problems and stresses, but it's crucial they find ways to manage them without involving or upsetting the children in the family. Thank you, Idi. I needed to hear that. Do you think there's anything I can do to make things better at home? Maybe talk to my parents about their issues? That's a great idea Modesta!

You can start by choosing a quiet moment when both parents are calm, and expressing how their arguments make you feel. Remember, it's okay to be honest about your emotions without blaming either parent. I think I understand what you're saying, Ambokile. But my parents have never been good at talking things out peacefully. The only time they ever speak calmly is when they're discussing something that doesn't affect me. It's challenging when communication isn't straightforward, Faraji. However, it's important to try and find a solution. Perhaps suggesting a family meeting where everyone can voice their concerns in a respectful manner could help. Or maybe seeking the advice of a counselor or trusted relative might provide some guidance on how to improve communication within your household.

I've noticed that she has stopped participating in activities she used to enjoy. The other day, she mentioned feeling like no one understands her or cares about her.

Depression can make people feel isolated and disconnected, and it's important that she knows she isn't alone in this. Have you spoken with her about what she's feeling? Sometimes just talking about our feelings can help us understand them better and find ways to cope. If she's not ready to talk yet, that's okay. But encouraging her to open up might be a good first step. You're absolutely right, Leila.

In the meantime, let's also try to find a way to support Sabina emotionally and academically while we wait for them to resolve the issue. That sounds like a good plan.

She's 13 years old and I've noticed she seems troubled lately. I'm really sorry to hear that, Avelina. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? Well, she used to have a close group of friends, but recently they've started drifting apart. Blandina seems upset about it and I haven't seen her laughing or playing like she used to. It's worrying me. I understand your concern, Avelina. Friendship issues can be very difficult for young people. Have you spoken to Blandina about how she feels? Yes, I have. She mentioned that the girls in her group started hanging out with others and left her out. They used to spend a lot of time together, but now they rarely speak. It's been making her feel lonely and sad. That sounds very challenging for Blandina. Change can be tough, especially when it involves friendships. Have you suggested she try reaching out to the girls or finding new friends? Yes, I did suggest that, but she seems hesitant. She's worried they won't accept her anymore or that the new group won't be as close as her old friends were. I think she might need some support to help her through this. You're absolutely right, Avelina. It can take time for young people to adjust to changes and find their footing in new social situations.

The child's name is Kamili and she's 16 years old. Recently, she started making prank calls using our home phone. She laughs it off as just service testing, but I'm worried it might be more than that. I understand your concern, Tina. Pranks can sometimes escalate into something more serious if not addressed early. Have you noticed any changes in Kamili's behavior lately? Has she become more withdrawn or secretive? Or perhaps there have been changes in her school performance? I appreciate your vigilance, Tina. It's important to address these issues head-on. I would recommend speaking directly with Kamili about the prank calls and making it clear that such behavior is not acceptable.

I'd also like to suggest reaching out to her school counselor or teacher if you haven't already. They might have insight into any issues Kamili could be dealing with that are causing this behavior.

The more details you provide, the better I can help. Well, Jeni often seems sad and withdrawn. She doesn't play with other children like she used to, and she rarely smiles. Yesterday, I saw her crying in a corner by herself when she should have been at school. When I asked if everything was alright, she just shook her head and ran away.

I've tried speaking with her mother, but she seems unaware of the situation or unwilling to listen. I don't want to intrude on their privacy, but I feel compelled to help Jeni.

School-related issues can often feel overwhelming, especially when we're juggling multiple responsibilities. Can you tell me more about what's been causing you stress? Well, it's not just one thing. My teachers are always pushing us to perform well, and I feel like I'm not measuring up. And even though my grades have been improving, I still worry that they won't be good enough. I know it sounds silly, but it's been keeping me up at night. It's far from silly, Claudia. It's completely normal to feel anxious when there's a lot riding on your performance. However, it's important to remember that you are more than just grades. What do you enjoy doing outside of school? I love drawing and reading. I find both activities really relaxing, especially when I'm feeling stressed out. But lately, even those things haven't seemed as enjoyable because I can't shake off this anxiety. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. Anxiety can affect us in many ways, making it difficult to focus on the things we love. Have you tried any strategies to help manage your stress and anxiety?

But I can see how upset everyone is, and Dora seems different too. She used to be so lively and full of energy, but now she's withdrawn and moody. I'm really worried about her, Petero. I understand your concern, Elizabeth. It sounds like Dora might be seeking attention in an unhealthy way. Prank calls can often be a sign of underlying emotional distress. Is there any particular incident that triggered this behavior? No, not that I know of. It's been gradual, happening over the past few months. She's had some changes at school, a new teacher and a few classmates moving away, but nothing significant enough to cause such a drastic change in her behavior. It could be related to those changes, Elizabeth. Transitions can be difficult for young people, especially when they involve loss or uncertainty.

I will try talking to my parents about this. But what if they don't listen? If that happens, you could suggest setting some realistic goals together and developing a study plan. This can help reduce stress and ensure you have enough time for other activities too. That's a smart approach, Sarki! Remember, it's important to communicate openly with your parents and let them know how you feel. It might also be helpful to ask a teacher or counselor for advice on managing your workload better. Thank you, Janeth. I really appreciate your help. If I need more guidance in the future, can I reach out to you again? Of course, Sarki! You're always welcome to call the child helpline if you ever need someone to talk to or advice on any issue. Take care and good luck with school. Thank you, Janeth. You've been really helpful.

{"text": "Hello, is this the child helpline? Yes, I'm here to help you. You sound a bit distressed. Can you tell me your name and where you're calling from, Alama? I'm 16 years old and I'm from Missenyi, Kagera. I've been feeling really down lately, Naima. There's so much stress at home and school. My parents argue a lot, and at school, I struggle to keep up with the workload. It feels like an endless cycle of failure. I'm truly sorry to hear that you're going through this, Alama. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, but it doesn't have to be this way all the time. Let's see if we can find some ways to help you cope better with your situation. Firstly, I'd like to discuss some strategies for managing stress at home. Have you tried talking to your parents about their arguments or finding a quiet place to study when they're not around? It might also be helpful to express your feelings and concerns to them so they can understand what you're going through. Regarding the schoolwork, it may be beneficial to seek help from a teacher or counselor there. They can provide additional resources and support to help you catch up with your studies. Additionally, setting smaller goals for yourself instead of trying to tackle everything at once could make the workload seem more manageable. It's also crucial to take care of your mental health by engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as reading a book, listening to music, or exercising regularly. Try to find some time each day for self-care, even if it's just a few minutes.

If not, could you please tell them so they can take you to a doctor? Elia said she's afraid her parents will be angry because they might think she was careless. I understand that fear, but it's crucial to prioritize getting medical attention for your injury. Accidents happen, and it's not fair to blame the victim. If it helps, you can explain that you were just playing and didn't mean to get hurt. I also suggested that Elia apply a cold compress on her arm to help reduce swelling and manage pain until she can see a doctor.

There's something happening at home that's been bothering me a lot lately. My parents... they constantly criticize and belittle me. They make me feel worthless and I don't know what to do. I see, Andongwisye. I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It must be very difficult for you. Can you tell me more about what they say or do? Are there any specific situations or incidents that stand out in your mind? Well... they always tell me that I'm not good enough, no matter what I do. They make fun of my schoolwork and laugh at my mistakes. I try to do better but it never seems to be enough for them. It makes me feel sad and confused. I understand how you're feeling, Andongwisye. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and it's okay not to be perfect all the time. Would it help if I shared some strategies with you on how to cope with this kind of situation? Yes, please. I would really appreciate that. Great! One strategy is to try and communicate openly and honestly with your parents about how their words are making you feel. Let them know that their criticism hurts you and that you need support rather than belittlement. It might be hard, but it's important to stand up for yourself.

I'm 14 years old and... well, things have been tough at home recently. There's a lot of fighting and it's gotten so bad that we had to leave our house and move to a relative's place. I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, Safi. Moving away from home can be very difficult, especially during such uncertain times. Can you tell me more about what led to the conflict at your home? How has the move affected you so far? It all started when my older brother got involved with a group of people who were causing trouble in our neighborhood. The police came and arrested them, but some of their friends retaliated by damaging our house and threatening us. We had no choice but to leave. The move has been hard, Amri. My school is far away from where we moved, so I have to walk for over an hour each way. It's tiring, and it makes it difficult for me to keep up with my studies. On top of that, I miss my friends and the familiarity of my old neighborhood. I understand how you feel, Safi. It can be overwhelming to deal with all these changes at once. Have you spoken to anyone about your concerns regarding school and the long walk? Maybe there's a way to find a solution for that. As for missing your friends and feeling homesick, it's important to remember that this is only temporary.

At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it has continued for weeks now. She laughs and seems unbothered by the consequences, even when she gets into trouble because of them. It's not like her at all. I see. Has Avelina ever done anything like this before? Not that I can recall. She's always been a sweet and obedient child.

I completely understand your concerns, Ambokile. Have you spoken with Avelina about this behavior? Yes, I have. But she always denies it and becomes defensive. She says she doesn't know who could be making those calls if it isn't her. It's frustrating because I don't know what to believe. It can be challenging when a child refuses to acknowledge their actions. Have you considered speaking with a counselor or psychologist who may be able to help Avelina understand why she's behaving this way and find healthier ways to seek attention?

Academic pressure can be quite intense, and it sounds like Sanyu is feeling overwhelmed. How have you noticed this affecting her? Well, she's been experiencing sleepless nights, loss of appetite, and constant worrying. She feels as though she must excel in every subject to please everyone.

What steps have you taken so far to address this issue, Dorcas? Have you spoken with Sanyu about it? I have discussed the matter with her, and she understands that I'm concerned. However, she's hesitant to speak to her teachers or school counselor because she fears they might think less of her if she admits to struggling. That's a common concern among students dealing with academic pressure, Dorcas. It's important to remind Sanyu that seeking help is not a sign of weakness but rather a show of strength and determination. You're absolutely right, Dorcas.

It's natural to feel scared when confronting difficult situations, Frida. But remember that you have the right to be heard and to feel safe at school.

There's a 14-year-old boy named Japhet who lives with me and I've noticed he's been struggling with his schoolwork. He seems to have undiagnosed learning disabilities, but we can't afford to take him for an assessment or additional support. I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, Kamili. It's essential that Japhet receives the help he needs to succeed in school and beyond. Can you tell me more about what kind of difficulties he's experiencing? Japhet has trouble reading, writing, and understanding complex concepts compared to his peers. He often falls behind on assignments, gets frustrated easily, and loses focus during class. Sometimes he even refuses to go to school because he feels overwhelmed. That sounds incredibly challenging for both Japhet and you, Kamili. It's important to remember that many children struggle with learning difficulties, and there are resources available to help. Have you explored any local schools or organizations in Singida that might be able to provide additional support? Unfortunately, I haven't had much success in finding assistance for Japhet so far. I've reached out to a few schools nearby, but they require extensive documentation and financial support that we simply don't have access to. Do you have any suggestions on where else I could look or what steps I can take to secure help for him? There are various options you can consider, Kamili. You may want to reach out to local NGOs, community organizations, or even government programs that offer educational support for children with learning disabilities.

I just want my daughter to feel safe and secure at school. I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, Josphat. It's important that your daughter feels heard and protected. Firstly, it would be beneficial to speak with Florida's teachers or the school principal about this issue. Explain the situation and ask for their support in addressing the bullying. Additionally, you can encourage Florida to talk about her feelings and help her find ways to assert herself if she encounters bullies again. It might also be helpful for her to have a trusted adult at school with whom she can confide. If the situation does not improve or escalates, I would advise reporting it to local authorities, such as the police or child welfare services.

Firstly, I suggested having an open conversation with France, expressing concern and offering a listening ear. I emphasized the importance of creating a safe space where France can share her feelings without fear of judgment or blame. Secondly, I advised Violet to encourage France to engage in activities that she enjoys. This could help distract her from the stress at home and provide an outlet for any pent-up emotions.

{"text": "Hello, child helpline? Yes, I need help. My name is Haji from Magu, Mwanza. I'm concerned about my granddaughter, Juliana, who's 11 years old. She's been acting strangely lately and I've noticed some worrying signs. A few days ago, she came home with a new dress that I didn't buy. When I asked her where she got it from, she said a woman at school had given it to her. The woman apparently works at a dance academy and promised Juliana that she could learn to dance there. But when I called the dance academy, they denied knowing anything about her or having any such program. I'm worried that this might be a case of human trafficking. She's been talking more and more about going to the city for auditions and has even mentioned some unfamiliar names of people who allegedly work in the entertainment industry. I don't want anything bad to happen to her, Juma. I feel helpless. I've tried speaking with Juliana, but she gets defensive and insists that everything is fine. She keeps saying she wants to make something of herself and that this is her chance. But I can see the fear in her eyes when she talks about it. What should I do, Juma? How can I protect her from this? I'm scared for her future. Please help me find a way out of this situation. She's just a child and doesn't understand the dangers. I appreciate your help, Juma. Thank you for listening to me. I feel a bit better knowing that someone is aware of the situation and is willing to help.

I have a concern about a child in my neighborhood, Raha, who is 6 years old. I've noticed some signs of distress and I believe she might be experiencing gender-based violence at home. I'm truly sorry to hear that, Aailyah. It's important that we take these concerns seriously. Can you tell me more about what led you to believe Raha is being harmed? Well, over the past few weeks, I've noticed that she has become withdrawn and seems fearful around her father. She often comes to me with unexplained injuries and refuses to discuss them. Yesterday, I heard her crying loudly from their house late at night, and when I went to check on her, she ran away and hid in the backyard. That sounds incredibly worrying, Aailyah. It's crucial that Raha receives support as soon as possible. I'd like to gather some more information before we take any further action. Can you tell me if there have been any other signs of abuse or if anyone else has noticed anything concerning about Raha? Actually, her teacher mentioned to me last week that Raha seems distracted and unable to focus in class. I've also overheard Raha's younger brother saying that their father is harsh with her. I'm planning on speaking with the school counselor about this as well. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Aailyah. We will work together to ensure Raha receives the help she needs.

It sounds like you care deeply about Natron. Have you tried talking to him about how he's feeling? Maybe he'd open up more if he knew you were concerned. Yes, I have. He initially brushed it off as just being tired and stressed from school, but his condition hasn't improved despite rest. I'm worried it might be something serious. It could indeed be something physical, Adelina. However, there's also a strong possibility that his physical health concerns may be connected to his mental state. Has Natron ever mentioned anything about being bullied or feeling overwhelmed at school? I haven't heard him mention any such things explicitly, but he does seem more withdrawn than usual. He used to be very active and outgoing before this started. That could be a sign of stress or anxiety, Adelina. It's important we get Natron the help he needs. Have you considered reaching out to his school or a local healthcare provider? They should have resources available to assist him. I will definitely reach out to his school and find a local healthcare provider for him. Thank you so much for your advice, Shangazi. I feel much more equipped to handle this situation now.

{"text": "Hi, this is Betty from the child helpline. How can I support you today? I'm Jonathan from Mjini Unguja, Mjini Magharibi. I have a concern about my granddaughter Jina who is 9 years old. I believe she's been working in hazardous conditions at a local market. I noticed she has bruises on her arms and legs, and she's always tired when she comes home. She seems scared to talk about what she does during the day. I'm really sorry to hear that, Jonathan. It sounds like Jina might be in a difficult situation. Have you spoken to anyone else about your concerns? No, I haven't. I don't want to scare her or make things worse by involving others yet. But I'm worried she might be in danger if this continues. It's important to address the issue as soon as possible, Jonathan. Can you tell me more about what kind of work she does and who she works for? She helps sell fruits and vegetables at the market every day. The vendor is a family friend but he seems very strict with her. He often makes her work long hours and doesn't provide her with proper protection like gloves or shoes. I tried talking to him about it, but he just dismissed my concerns and said she needs to learn responsibility. That sounds concerning, Jonathan. Child labor is illegal in Tanzania, and working in such hazardous conditions can be harmful for a child's health and development. I will do my best to help you find a solution for Jina. In the meantime, I would suggest that you encourage her to talk about what she goes through during the day. I'll try to approach her gently, Betty. Thank you so much for your help.

I have a concern about Reth, a 15-year-old child in my community. Lately, he's been making prank calls to people and it's causing a lot of distress. It seems like he's doing it for attention, but I fear it might escalate if not addressed. I see. That sounds concerning, Vincent. Attention-seeking behavior can sometimes indicate an underlying issue that the child may be struggling with. Have you spoken to Reth about this yet? Not directly, no. I've noticed he's been more withdrawn recently and his school performance has suffered. I want to approach him sensitively, but I don't know how to go about it without causing further distress or misunderstanding. It's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, Vincent. You could start by expressing your concerns and letting him know you're there for him. If you feel overwhelmed, it might be helpful to involve a trusted adult or school counselor. Thank you, Lucy. I appreciate your advice. I'll try speaking with Reth soon and see if we can find a solution together. It means a lot to have someone to talk to about this. Of course, Vincent. Remember, it's okay not to have all the answers.

It can be very hard dealing with arguments in a relationship, especially when you're both still young. Can you tell me more about what you two argue about?

I was wondering if you could tell me more about scholarships available for secondary education? Of course, Maryam. I'm glad you reached out. Scholarships can be a great way to help with educational expenses. Let's see... There are several organizations that offer scholarships for secondary education in Tanzania. One such organization is the Aga Khan Foundation. They provide scholarships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. That sounds interesting, but I'm not sure if I qualify. How can I find out if I'm eligible? To be eligible for an Aga Khan Foundation scholarship, you typically need to meet certain academic and financial criteria. You should check their website for the most up-to-date information on eligibility requirements. I see. And what about other organizations that offer scholarships? There are indeed several other organizations that offer scholarships in Tanzania. For example, the MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program provides full scholarships to academically talented yet economically disadvantaged students. The African Leadership Academy also offers scholarships for exceptional students from across Africa. Thank you so much! This is really helpful. I'll definitely look into those organizations and their requirements. If I have more questions or need further assistance, can I call back? Absolutely, Maryam.

This is indeed a serious matter. Have you spoken with Mwakipesile about this? If so, how did he respond? Yes, I did speak with him.

No, I haven't reported it to anyone. I was afraid that I might scare Mwakipesile more or make things worse. But now I realize I need help and support. What should I do next?

{"text": "Hi, this is Mwazighe from the child helpline. How can I support you today? I'm Buruji, a 25-year-old resident of Arusha Mjini. I have an eleven-year-old girl named Miriam living with me who has been exhibiting unusual behavior lately. She keeps making prank calls to my friends and family members, causing quite a stir. I'm worried this might be attention-seeking behavior that needs addressing. I understand your concerns, Buruji. It sounds like Miriam may need some help managing her emotions or finding healthier ways to seek attention. Prank calls can indeed cause distress and confusion for others. Can you tell me more about why you think she might be doing this? Has there been any recent change in her life that could be contributing to these behaviors, such as a move, family issues, or school problems? I'm sorry, but I don't have much information on that front. Miriam moved in with me a few months ago after her parents passed away, and she seemed to adapt well initially. However, lately, she has become more withdrawn and moody. Her school performance hasn't been affected yet, but I fear it might if this behavior continues. I see. It's possible that Miriam is struggling with grief and finding it difficult to cope without her parents. Loss can certainly affect a child's emotional well-being and lead to behaviors like the ones you've described. Have you tried talking to Miriam about what she might be feeling? Sometimes just opening up a conversation can help a child express their emotions more openly. I have, but it seems she gets defensive or changes the subject whenever I try. I worry that if I push too hard, I may hurt her feelings or make her withdraw further.

Academic perfectionism is indeed challenging and can affect our mental health if not managed properly. Can you tell me more about how this is impacting your daily life? Well, I spend so much time studying and worrying about grades that I hardly have any free time to relax or hang out with friends. And when I do make a mistake on an exam or an assignment, I can't help but dwell on it for days. It really takes a toll on me emotionally. I see.

I believe he might be a victim of human trafficking. Oh dear, that sounds very serious. Can you tell me more about what has happened? Masomakali recently met an older man named Mwalimu Salum who approached him with promises of better opportunities and education in Dar es Salaam. He convinced Masomakali to leave Chamwino for the city, saying that his family was struggling financially and couldn't afford to support him anymore. However, since arriving in Dar es Salaam, Masomakali has been forced into labor at a construction site, working long hours without pay. I'm so sorry to hear that. This is indeed a grave concern. I strongly recommend contacting the local police and inform them about the situation immediately. They will be able to take appropriate action and assist you in finding Masomakali.

Now, regarding Queen, it's crucial to understand that depression often stems from a combination of factors such as genetics, life events, and mental health history. In Queen's case, her biological predisposition might play a role. It would be beneficial if we could arrange for Queen to see a mental health professional who specializes in pediatric care. They can assess her condition more accurately and provide appropriate treatment options. I can help you with resources and guidance on how to approach this situation sensitively, Asani. In the meantime, it's essential to encourage open communication with Queen. Try talking to her about her feelings, letting her know that it's okay to express herself and that she doesn't have to face this alone.

{"text": "Hello, child helpline? I'm Nancy, how can I assist you today? I'm Mwasongwe from Bahi, Dodoma. I have a concerning situation regarding my 13-year-old nephew, Clement. I've noticed he's been acting differently lately and I fear he might be being physically abused by his older brother. Oh dear, I'm really sorry to hear that, Mwasongwe. Physical abuse is a serious matter and it's important we take steps to ensure Clement's safety. Can you tell me more about what you've observed? Yes, of course. It started when they were playing a few weeks ago. I saw marks on Clement's body that looked like bruises. He tried to hide them but I managed to see them. Then, last week, he came home with his shirt torn and blood stains on it. When I asked him about it, he said his brother got angry during a game and lost control. That sounds very troubling, Mwasongwe. It's important to remember that no child should have to endure such violence at home. Have you spoken with Clement about this? Has he shared any feelings or fears with you? I've tried talking to him, but he gets scared and changes the subject. He says it's just a one-time thing and his brother won't do it again. But I worry that it might happen again. I understand your concerns, Mwasongwe. It's common for children who are being abused to minimize the situation or deny it altogether due to fear or shame. Have you considered reporting this to local authorities? They can provide resources and support to help Clement and ensure his safety.

But they keep saying that if I don't do what they want, then they won't be my friends anymore. And I really don't want to lose them because they are the only ones I have here in school. I see, Jeremiah. It's natural to feel worried about losing friends, but it's even more important to take care of yourself and make safe choices. Remember that true friendship should never require you to do something that makes you uncomfortable or puts you at risk. But what if I tell them no? They might still laugh at me or call me names. I don't know if I can handle that. I understand your concerns, Jeremiah. It's important to remember that not everyone will always understand or agree with your choices.

{"text": "Hi, this is the child helpline. How can I support you today? I'm Katalina from Kiteto, Manyara. There's something concerning me about my grandson, Masomakali, who's 13 years old. Lately, he's been acting differently and I'm worried it might be due to his parents' conflicts. I understand that parental conflicts can be tough on children, Katalina. Could you share more about what you've observed in Masomakali? Well, he seems withdrawn and often looks anxious. His grades have dropped significantly at school too. And I've noticed a difference in his usual playful demeanor – he rarely laughs or engages in activities as much as before. That sounds like quite a change for him. Have there been any specific incidents that stand out to you? Yes, there was one time when his father and mother had a heated argument late at night, and Masomakali came to my house crying. He didn't want to go home because he said it wasn't safe there. I tried talking to them about it the next day, but they both claimed nothing out of the ordinary happened. I see. It's important to address these issues, Katalina. I would suggest speaking with Masomakali directly and asking him how he feels about his parents' disagreements. Sometimes children might feel too scared or embarrassed to bring up their concerns themselves. That's a good point, Suzan. I plan on doing that, but I want to make sure I approach the conversation sensitively so as not to upset him further. Do you have any advice for how to broach this topic with him? Absolutely.

Josphat's parents have been arguing more frequently lately, creating an emotionally charged environment at home. This tension has led to increased stress for Josphat, who is struggling to cope.

I fear for his life if he continues without proper medical attention. What should I do, Agnes? I care about this child deeply and feel helpless watching him suffer. You are absolutely right to be concerned, Mwakalinga. Neglect can have serious consequences for a child's health and wellbeing. Firstly, it's important that you document your observations. Write down details such as the symptoms you've noticed in Cosmas, the dates of his last medical visit, and any interactions with his parents regarding this issue. This information will be valuable should we need to involve other authorities. Secondly, I would suggest reaching out to local community leaders or school officials.

I have a concern about my neighbor's daughter, Tina, who is 12 years old. I fear she might be involved in something terrible - human trafficking, possibly sex trafficking. I noticed her behavior has changed drastically over the past few weeks. She used to be a cheerful and playful girl but now she seems withdrawn, scared, and anxious all the time. Her eyes are always red, as if she hasn't slept well, and she avoids eye contact. Yesterday, when I was taking my laundry out, I heard strange noises coming from her house at odd hours of the night. When I went to check, there were two unfamiliar vehicles parked outside, but I couldn't see anything through the windows due to the darkness. Tina usually walks home from school alone, but since this has started, she often comes back with different men who seem older and aggressive. They never speak to me or acknowledge my presence, which is unusual for our neighborhood. I've tried talking to her, but she either cries or changes the subject. I think she's scared to tell me what's happening. I don't know what else to do. I appreciate your help, Dina. I just want to make sure Tina is safe and can get out of this situation if she's indeed being exploited. I understand your concerns, Ambidwile.

It sounds like Epifania might be struggling with the high expectations she has set for herself. This kind of perfectionism can indeed be detrimental if not addressed early. Firstly, it's essential to communicate with her openly about her feelings and encourage her to express herself without fear of judgment or disappointment. Let her know that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Secondly, help Epifania develop a balanced perspective on her academic performance. Praise her for effort rather than just results.

However, let's not jump to conclusions yet. It could simply be an innocent prank or just service testing. But if you notice any changes in his behavior, like becoming withdrawn or showing signs of distress, it might be a good idea to have a conversation with him about it. Thank you for your advice, Paulina. I'll keep an eye on things and talk to Florian when the opportunity arises. If the situation worsens, I won't hesitate to call again. Thank you for your help.

I'm worried because she hasn't been well recently, and her parents don't seem to be giving her proper medical attention. She fell ill a week ago with high fever and vomiting, but they didn't take her to the hospital. Instead, they've been giving her traditional medicine. I've tried speaking with them about this, but they dismiss my concerns. I fear for her health, Hala. She looks weak and unwell. I understand your concern, Stela. It sounds like Miriam needs immediate medical attention. Have you noticed any changes in her eating or drinking habits? And has she been able to keep food down without vomiting? These are important details that can help us assess the situation better. She's hardly eaten anything for the past few days and when she does, it comes back up within minutes. It breaks my heart to see her like this. I think they might be neglecting her medical needs intentionally. But I don't know what to do. I can't stand by and watch a child suffer. It's not easy, Stela, but you're doing the right thing by reaching out. We can help. Firstly, it would be beneficial if you could document any instances of her illness, symptoms, and anything else that might help us understand the situation better. This will be crucial for any reports or interventions we may need to make. Also, try to gather more information about Miriam's living conditions and family dynamics.

About three months ago, Agnes started staying out late without any explanation. At first, I thought it was just a phase, but then she stopped coming home altogether.

The farm is called Mwabvita Farm and it's located just outside Missenyi town.

Remember to eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. These things are crucial for maintaining good physical and mental health. It's also important to set aside some time each day for relaxation or hobbies you enjoy. This can help reduce stress and improve your mood. Lastly, if the stress continues or worsens, consider talking to a trusted adult like a teacher or parent about how you feel. They may be able to offer additional support or guidance. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that there are people who care about you and want to help.

You see, I want to join a local theater group that performs plays about important issues in our community, but the adults in charge won't let me because they say I'm too young. It's not fair! I really believe that children should have the right to express themselves and be heard, especially on issues that affect us directly. I understand your feelings, Salima. Participation rights are important for every child. It sounds like you have a passion for theater and using it as a platform to raise awareness about community issues. Have you tried talking to someone else about this? Maybe an older sibling, teacher, or community leader who could help advocate for your participation in the group? I've spoken to my parents, but they don't want me to get involved in any activities outside of school because it might distract me from my studies. I understand their concerns, but I also think that being part of this theater group will help me learn more about our community and develop important skills like communication and empathy. It's great that you've discussed this with your parents already, Salima. Sometimes it can be helpful to seek additional support from someone who can provide guidance on how to navigate difficult situations. Have you considered reaching out to a local children's rights organization or even the school principal to discuss your concerns and express your desire to participate in the theater group?

If possible, try to learn the nature of her work, where she goes, who she works for, and how long she's been doing this. This will help us determine if it's truly child labor and what kind of support she might need.

Well, it all started a few months ago when a new family moved into our neighborhood and offered Madina's family some money to let her work as a domestic helper for them. At first, we thought it was just a temporary arrangement, but then they took her away without returning for weeks at a time.

Have there been any signs of abuse or exploitation? Yes, we've noticed that Madina comes back looking tired and withdrawn whenever she returns home. She rarely talks about what happened during the days she was away, and when we try to ask her questions, she becomes defensive and avoids giving straight answers.

You see, I've been noticing changes in my body recently and it's making me feel a bit confused. That's completely normal, Bakari. Puberty is a time of significant growth and change for every teenager. You may have started developing secondary sexual characteristics like body hair or voice changes.

Additionally, if you have any questions regarding personal hygiene during this time, I'd be happy to address those as well.

Hormonal fluctuations can lead to mood swings and feelings of stress or anxiety, which are common among teenagers during this stage. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or upset, remember that it's okay to seek support from friends, family, or trusted adults. It might be helpful for you to talk about your concerns with someone close to you. Open communication can often alleviate feelings of confusion and provide reassurance.

Yes, there have been some changes. Her parents got divorced recently and she seems upset about it. She's been more moody than usual, and I think the prank calls are her way of trying to cope.

It might also be helpful to involve a mutual family friend or a trusted elder from both your and her tribes to mediate the conversation. I understand that confronting your father about this might be difficult, but remember, it's important to have open and respectful communication within the family.

I have a concern about my 15-year-old daughter, Salama. I believe she may be involved in some kind of child labor and exploitative employment. I'm really sorry to hear that, Mwangosi. That must be very distressing for you. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? How did you come to this conclusion? I noticed changes in Salama's behavior. She used to be a cheerful girl who loved going to school, but now she seems withdrawn and tired all the time. I asked her about it, and she said that she has been working at a local factory after school to help with our family's finances. That sounds concerning, Mwangosi. Child labor can be harmful and exploitative, especially in factories. It's important for children to have access to education and a safe environment to grow and develop. Have you spoken to Salama about your concerns? Yes, I have, but she became defensive and told me that she is doing her part to help the family. She also said that her boss has been treating her fairly and pays her for her work. However, I still worry that she may be working in an environment that's not safe or appropriate for a child.

I've been too scared to tell them because I don't want them to think I'm stupid. But now that I've told you, I feel a bit better. What should I do next, Fortunata? I think it's great that you opened up about this, Jeremy. It can be hard to admit when we need help, but asking for it is an important step towards overcoming challenges. You could start by talking to your teachers and explaining that you're having trouble understanding the lessons. They might be able to provide additional resources or support to help you succeed. It would also be a good idea to talk to your parents about this, so they can offer their support as well. If you'd like, I can help you prepare for these conversations by giving you some ideas of what to say and how to approach them. Does that sound helpful? Yes, that would really help me, Fortunata.

She's started making prank calls, pretending to be someone else, causing trouble for others. It's not like her at all. She's usually such a responsible child. I don't know what's happening.

It's clear that you love Anita very much. This situation must be very distressing for you and your family. It sounds like Anita is going through something and she might be using these prank calls as a way to cope or express her feelings.

They can provide Emma with the support and guidance she needs to cope with her feelings and work through her experiences. Another option would be family therapy sessions, where we can all discuss what's happening and find ways to support each other in healing. It might help Emma feel less alone and more understood.

I'm Yusra from Mbulu, Manyara and I have a concern about my 9-year-old daughter, Digna. She's been having some difficulties at school, particularly with attention and focus. It seems she struggles to concentrate during lessons and often falls behind. That sounds challenging for both you and Digna. Have there been any changes in her routine or environment that could be affecting her focus? Like a move, a new teacher, or maybe a stressful event at home? No significant changes have occurred recently. But it's been bothering me that she's been having trouble with basic tasks and often seems lost in thought during class. I'm concerned this may impact her academic progress if we don't address it soon. It's important to address those concerns promptly, Yusra. Have you discussed this issue with Digna or any of her teachers? If so, what did they say? Yes, I talked to her teacher, and she confirmed that Digna does seem to have trouble focusing during class. However, the teacher also mentioned that Digna is a bright child who shows great potential when she applies herself. The teacher suggested we consider getting her evaluated for learning difficulties or attention disorders. That's a good first step, Yusra. A professional evaluation can help determine if there are underlying issues affecting Digna's ability to focus and learn effectively.

Additionally, it might be helpful to reach out to local social services or child welfare agencies for further guidance and assistance. They can provide additional resources, such as counseling, food aid, and educational support.

It's been difficult for me to understand why because he was doing well in his previous school. I'm afraid the competitive environment at this new school might be causing him undue pressure. He used to enjoy learning but now he seems anxious all the time. I've tried talking to him about it, but he gets defensive and says he just needs to work harder to keep up.

He used to excel in school before this happened. I just want to find a solution so he can get back on track. I understand your concerns, Eva. Learning difficulties can be challenging for both the child and the family. It's great that you're reaching out for help. There are several options available for Fabiano. Firstly, I recommend scheduling an appointment with a pediatrician to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to his learning difficulties. Secondly, speaking with his teachers about his performance and seeking guidance on potential educational accommodations would also be beneficial. Additionally, there are tutoring services and support groups in Lindi that can provide additional assistance. I can help you find resources and connect you with professionals who specialize in helping children with learning difficulties. Remember, it's important to maintain open communication with Fabiano about his struggles and show him support during this time. Encourage him to express his feelings and seek understanding together. Eva, I appreciate your dedication to supporting Fabiano through these challenges. Together we can find ways to help him succeed academically and emotionally. Let's start by scheduling that appointment with a pediatrician and exploring other resources in Lindi.

She's been going through some troubling times recently and I'm deeply concerned about her well-being. She's been involved in ongoing conflict situations at home and school, and it seems like the threat is escalating. Her father has a history of alcohol abuse and he often becomes violent when drunk. Recently, Melania tried to stand up for herself and ended up being hurt. It breaks my heart to see her struggle, Salama. I'm not sure what to do to help her anymore. Is there anything you can suggest? I understand how difficult this must be for both of you, Mariam. It's important that Melania feels safe and protected, especially during these challenging times. Let me share some steps that could potentially help. Firstly, it would be beneficial to report the situation to local authorities. They can provide immediate assistance and ensure her safety if necessary. Additionally, reaching out to schools to inform them about the issue may help in creating a safer environment for Melania during school hours. It might also be helpful for Melania to speak with a counselor or psychologist who can offer guidance and support during these stressful times. I can provide you with resources for professional help if needed. Lastly, it's crucial that Melania understands she is not alone in this struggle. Encouraging her to express her feelings and emotions openly can help her cope better with the situation.

Lately, I've been feeling really stressed about school, especially my academic performance. I'm worried that I might fail in some subjects and my friends will laugh at me. That sounds like a lot to handle, Laurence. It's important to remember that everyone goes through tough times with their studies. Have you been spending enough time studying or is there something else causing this stress? I've been putting in the effort, but no matter how much I study, I still feel overwhelmed and anxious. That's a common feeling when we have high expectations for ourselves. It's important to manage these feelings so they don't take over and affect your performance even more. One way to do this is by breaking down your studies into smaller tasks. For example, instead of trying to understand an entire chapter in one go, break it up into smaller sections. Also, try to find a study routine that works best for you and stick with it. This consistency can help reduce anxiety and make studying feel more manageable. Another important thing is self-care. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals, and taking breaks when needed. Remember, your mental health is just as important as your academic success. It might be helpful to talk about these feelings with someone close to you like a parent or teacher, if you feel comfortable doing so.

Yesterday night, he made a prank call to a local business using our home phone, pretending to be the owner requesting unusual services for service testing purposes. I was shocked and confused, as this is not like him. He's always been responsible and considerate of others. I've tried talking to him about it but he just laughed it off and changed the subject. I fear that there might be more going on than I know. Is it normal for a teenager to act out like this? What should I do, Fatma? I understand your concern, Akili. It's not uncommon for teenagers to experiment with boundaries and explore their independence. However, prank calls can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues such as stress, peer pressure or even mental health problems. It's important to approach the situation sensitively yet firmly. Firstly, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with Mwasote about his actions. Let him know that you're concerned and explain why his behavior was inappropriate. If he continues to act out or if the behavior worsens, it might be helpful to seek professional advice from a counselor or psychologist. They can provide guidance on how best to support Mwasote through this period and help identify any underlying issues that may need addressing.

Well, umm... like yesterday, I got full marks on my math test and the teacher still told me to try harder next time. It made me feel sad because I thought I had done well. That sounds difficult, Jeni. It's important for teachers to encourage us to do our best, but it's not healthy when we're constantly criticized even when we succeed.

I'm really sorry to hear that, Jacqueline. Corporal punishment can have serious negative effects on a child's physical and emotional well-being. Can you tell me more about the situation? How often does this happen, and what specifically has led you to reach out to us today? I've seen Masomakali with bruises and cuts several times now. His father gets angry easily and lashes out physically when he disobeys or doesn't meet his expectations. Today, I saw him come home from school crying and holding his arm. When I asked what happened, he said his father had beaten him for not completing his homework on time. That sounds very concerning, Jacqueline. It's important to remember that all children have the right to be safe and protected from harm. Have you spoken with Masomakali about this situation? Does he feel comfortable talking about it with you? Yes, I have spoken with him. He is scared and doesn't know what to do. He's afraid of his father's anger if he tells anyone. I wanted to reach out for advice on how to help him without putting him in more danger. I understand your concerns, Jacqueline. It can be difficult knowing how to support a child who is experiencing abuse. One option might be to report the situation to the local authorities or social services.

Terezia is only 11 years old, and she's being subjected to gender-based violence and discrimination at school. The boys in her class treat her unfairly because she's a girl, and it's affecting her emotionally and academically.

Last week, her father hit her mother during an argument, causing her mother to fall. I was not present at the time but heard the commotion afterwards. It's been unsettling for Albina since then. I appreciate you sharing that with me, Victoria. It sounds like a difficult situation. Have there been any signs of distress from Albina? Has she shared anything about how she's feeling? Yes, she has. She's become more withdrawn and quiet than usual. She rarely eats or sleeps well. I believe her school work may also be affected as she seems to lack focus. The other day, she mentioned that she felt trapped at home, like there was no escape from the constant tension. I'm really sorry to hear that Albina is experiencing such feelings of helplessness and fear. It's crucial for her safety and well-being to seek help. Have you considered reaching out to local authorities or organizations that can offer support? Yes, I have.

Her elderly grandmother lives with them but is not able to provide for the family adequately. I'm afraid that Matilda feels obligated to contribute to their living expenses.

Have you talked to Adika about how she feels? It could be beneficial to have an open conversation about her feelings and the expectations you both have for her academic journey. Encourage her to express any worries or fears she may have, so you can work together to find solutions. I'd also like to suggest reaching out to Adika's teachers.

She's been making prank calls, testing various service numbers. While it might seem harmless, it's causing distress to the recipients. I've tried talking to her about it but she insists it's just a joke. However, I can see that it's affecting her relationship with others and I'm worried about her future actions. Do you have any suggestions on how I could approach this situation? I understand that it might be difficult for Olivia to grasp the severity of her actions if they are seen as a joke. It's important to help her understand the impact her prank calls can have on others, and the potential consequences of such behavior. One approach could be to explain the importance of empathy, and how her actions might cause distress or inconvenience to others who are not involved in the joke. You could also discuss the potential legal repercussions for making prank calls, as it can be considered a form of harassment. It's also crucial to emphasize that her behavior is affecting her relationships and may negatively impact her future opportunities, such as college applications or job prospects. Encourage Olivia to think about the long-term effects of her actions and how she could channel her energy into more productive activities. I appreciate your help in this matter, Naomi.

Well, lately, I've been experiencing changes in my body that I don't fully understand. I feel embarrassed to ask adults about it, and my friends don't seem to know much either. It's completely normal for you to have questions about your body, Epifania. Many young people go through the same thing. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been happening? Are there any specific changes that you're concerned about? One of the things I've noticed is that I'm starting to develop breasts. It's making me feel self-conscious and uncomfortable, especially at school. I also have irregular periods and I don't know what that means. It sounds like you're going through puberty, Epifania. The development of breasts and the onset of menstruation are both signs of this natural process. The irregular periods can be normal during the beginning stages but if they persist or cause discomfort, it might be a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider. I see. I'm not sure if I should talk to my parents about this though. They might react poorly or make me feel even more embarrassed.

It can be difficult to reach out for help, but it's an important step towards finding a solution. I'd like to offer you some advice on how to cope with this situation and provide support if needed. Would that be okay with you? Yes, thank you. I would really appreciate your help. I'm glad to hear that. One thing you could try is talking to someone you trust about what's been happening at home. It might also be helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal or speak with a counselor if you feel comfortable doing so.

{"text": "Hi, this is the child helpline. How can I support you today? I'm Lilian from Hai, Kilimanjaro. There's a concern about a 7-year-old child named Asubuhi in my family. I've noticed that she's been acting differently lately and I fear she might be experiencing gender-based violence or discrimination. I'm so sorry to hear that, Lilian. It's important to address these concerns as soon as possible. Can you tell me more about what you've observed in Asubuhi? What kind of changes have you noticed in her behavior? Over the past few weeks, she has become very quiet and withdrawn. She rarely plays with other children now, and when she does, it seems like she's being left out or teased. I've also overheard some boys using derogatory comments about girls in general around her. That sounds concerning, Lilian. It's essential to provide a safe environment for Asubuhi. Have you spoken with anyone in the family or school about this issue? I have talked to her mother, but she's unsure of what to do next. We are considering reporting it to the school authorities, but I wanted to get some advice before taking any steps. That's a wise decision, Lilian. Reporting incidents like these is an important step in addressing the issue and ensuring that Asubuhi is safe. I can help you prepare for this conversation with the school authorities. Let's discuss some strategies for approaching the situation together. Thank you, Kumi. Your help means a lot to me and my family. I appreciate your support during this difficult time.

I need help because my parents are often not home and I'm left alone for long periods. They work late at the farm and they don't seem to notice that I'm struggling. I've told them before but they didn't seem to care much. I understand, Fabian. It must be really scary and overwhelming to feel like you're on your own. You didn't deserve to be ignored by your parents, no child should have to go through this. Schoolwork is piling up and I can't focus with all the worries in my head. I miss them when they're away but I also worry about being alone at home. I don't know who to turn to or what to do. It sounds like a lot, Fabian. Let me share some suggestions that might help you navigate through this tough time. Firstly, it's important for you to reach out to someone you trust - a teacher, a counselor, or even a close friend who can support you when your parents are away. That's a great idea. I can help you identify a trusted adult at school that you feel comfortable speaking with. Additionally, we could also work on ways for you to communicate more effectively with your parents about your concerns. I appreciate that, Akida. It helps knowing there's someone out there who understands and wants to help me. Can we schedule another call in a few days so I can update you on how things are going? That would make me feel less alone. Of course, Fabian. We can set up a time that works for both of us.

I'm afraid I might not be able to keep up with everything. I see. It's good that you've spoken with your teacher about this already. Let's consider a few options together. Firstly, could you ask your teacher if there's a possibility to prioritize your assignments? This way, you can focus on the most important tasks first. That's a good idea. I think I'll try that tomorrow when school starts again. Is there anything else I can do, like asking for help from my classmates or parents if needed? Absolutely! Collaborating with your classmates and involving your parents in your studies can be very beneficial. It will not only ease the burden but also help you understand the material better. Emilia, I'm really proud of you for reaching out and asking for help. Remember that it's important to take care of yourself and seek support when needed.

I feel like there's too much pressure at school, especially with academics. It's not just about getting good grades; it feels like I have to be perfect in everything. I understand how you feel, Beatrice. It can be overwhelming to feel like you need to excel in every aspect. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been causing this stress for you? Well, lately, my teachers have been expecting me to do better and better on tests. And even at home, my parents are always comparing me with other students who seem to be doing better than me. It's really hard to keep up sometimes. That sounds tough, Beatrice. Comparing yourself to others can create unnecessary pressure. How about we focus on your progress rather than comparing it with others? I believe that you have unique strengths and talents that set you apart. I know that's true, but it's hard to remember when I see other students excelling while I struggle. Sometimes I feel like giving up because I think I'll never be good enough. It's normal to feel overwhelmed at times, Beatrice. Remember, giving up isn't an option here. Instead, let's work together to find strategies that can help you manage this pressure and improve your academic performance in a healthier way. Thank you, Valentina. I appreciate your support. Do you have any specific suggestions for managing the pressure? Absolutely, Beatrice! Firstly, try setting realistic goals for yourself and break them down into smaller, achievable steps.

Recently, she's been acting differently and I suspect it might be due to some issues at school or with friends. Oh, that sounds concerning, Joyce. It's important to address this issue as soon as possible. Could you tell me more about the changes you've noticed in Rabia? Well, she's been very quiet and seems to be avoiding her friends lately. She also appears anxious and upset when using her phone or computer. I think she might be experiencing some sort of cyberbullying. I see. Cyberbullying can indeed have a significant impact on a child's emotional wellbeing. Have you talked to Rabia about this? If so, what has she shared with you? Yes, I have spoken to her but she didn't want to discuss it much. She only said that some classmates have been mean to her online and that it hurts a lot. I've also noticed messages on her phone containing hurtful comments. It breaks my heart to see her going through this. I understand how distressing this must be for you, Joyce. It's crucial to support Rabia in dealing with this situation and help her find ways to cope. One step we can take is reporting the cyberbullying to the school authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate actions.

Lately, she's been making prank calls to people she knows, pretending to be someone else and causing distress. It's worrying because it seems like attention-seeking behavior and I don't know how to handle it. I understand your concern, Radhi. Prank calls can be a sign of underlying issues that the child might be dealing with. It could be that Domina is seeking validation or trying to cope with something difficult in her life. The important thing is to approach this situation with understanding and patience. Firstly, it's crucial to have an open conversation with Domina about her actions. Let her know that you care about her and that her behavior is causing concern. Encourage her to talk openly about what she might be feeling or experiencing that could lead to this kind of attention-seeking behavior. It's essential to create a safe space for her to express herself without judgment. If Domina seems resistant to discussing her feelings, you might want to involve a trusted adult figure such as a teacher or family member who can help guide the conversation. They could offer additional perspective and possibly provide insight into any issues that might be affecting Domina. It's also important to monitor Domina's use of technology and set clear boundaries regarding appropriate phone behavior. If necessary, restricting her access to phones or limiting call time could help break the cycle of prank calls. Lastly, consider seeking professional help if Domina continues to exhibit problematic behaviors.

I've been experiencing gender-based violence at home. My father has been treating me unfairly because I'm a boy, while he showers affection on my sisters. He says that since they are girls, they will carry on our family name, but I don't understand why I should be treated differently just because I'm a boy. I feel really sad and confused, Vincent. I thought my father loved me, but now I'm not so sure. It hurts to see my sisters being treated better than me, especially since they often make mistakes too. I know this isn't fair, Sabas. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment. Your feelings are valid, and it's crucial to talk about them. I'd like to help you find a solution to this problem. First, I suggest talking to someone you trust about what's happening. This could be a teacher, family member, or friend. You don't have to face this alone. If you can't talk to someone in person, you can also write a letter or email to express your feelings. Secondly, it may help to document any instances of abuse or discrimination that occur. Write down the date, time, and details about what happened so that you have evidence if needed. Lastly, if the violence continues and affects your safety, I encourage you to reach out to local authorities or organizations that can offer support and protection. It's important to prioritize your well-being.

I can understand how frustrating that must feel, Mwinyimkuu. Prank calls can be unsettling and disruptive. Have you tried talking to the people who are calling you?

I've even considered changing my number, but I don't want to cut ties with them completely. Is there any other way I can handle this situation? It's great that you don't want to lose touch with your friends altogether. One possible solution could be setting boundaries and making it clear that their prank calls are not acceptable. You might also want to consider blocking their numbers temporarily if they continue to bother you. I guess I can try that, but I'm worried they won't understand or respect my boundaries. What if they get angry with me? It's natural to feel apprehensive about setting boundaries, especially when it comes to friends. However, it's important to remember that your feelings and well-being matter too. If your friends care about you, they should listen and respect your wishes.

I've been dealing with a difficult situation at home... my caregiver has become very frustrated and often lashes out physically. It's been happening quite frequently lately. I'm really sorry to hear that, Sarah. I can understand how scary and confusing that must feel for you. Have you spoken to anyone about this before? Are there any trusted adults in your life who know about this situation? There is one adult I trust - my school counselor. I tried talking to her once but she didn't seem to take me seriously. She just told me to try to be more understanding with my caregiver and not make them angry anymore. But it doesn't help, Aisha. It keeps happening... I see. That must have been very disappointing. Let me reassure you that I'm here for you now, and I will do everything I can to help. Can you tell me more about the physical abuse? What kind of things is your caregiver doing? Well, they've been hitting me and yelling at me a lot. They say it's because I'm not pulling my weight around the house or because I don't listen to them. But it's more than that, Aisha. It's like they're angry all the time... I'm really sorry to hear that, Sarah. Physical abuse is never okay and you do not deserve to be treated this way.

I miss a lot of classes because of this, and it's affecting my grades. I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, Motogusinile. Educational neglect can have a big impact on a child's life. It's important for children to go to school regularly and receive help with their homework so they can learn and grow. I understand that it might be hard to talk about this, but do you know why your parents don't seem to care about your education? I'm not sure, Adla. They just don't seem to prioritize it. Sometimes they say they have other things to take care of, but I think they forget that my education is important too. I feel like no one cares about me or my future. It makes me sad and scared. I can understand why you might be feeling this way, Motogusinile. It's natural to feel sad and worried when things aren't going well at home. But there are people who care about you and want to help.

Divorce can be hard for everyone involved, but I'm here to help you. It's really important to talk about what you're going through and find a way to keep safe. Have you told anyone else about the violence? No, I haven't. I was scared they wouldn't believe me or that they would tell my father. But it's getting harder to hide it. He's been shouting at me, hitting me, and even threatening me. I understand how difficult it must be to keep this a secret, but it's important for you to tell someone you trust. If you can't talk to a family member or teacher, there are other options. You could speak with a counselor or social worker at school, or reach out to a local domestic violence helpline. I will try. I don't want to put my family through more trouble, but I also don't want to keep living in fear. What can I do to stay safe? First and foremost, it's important for you to prioritize your own safety.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that Shani. Separation can indeed be challenging for children. Can you tell me more about what has been happening with Emmanuel? Yes, his father has become increasingly aggressive towards him. The physical and emotional abuse has escalated since the separation, and it's affecting Emmanuel's well-being significantly. I fear for his safety if things don't change soon. I understand your concerns Shani. Domestic violence is a serious issue that requires immediate attention. Have you considered reaching out to local authorities or social services? They can provide resources and support to help protect Emmanuel. Yes, I have contacted the local police, but they were unable to intervene as there's no evidence of physical harm. However, I believe that the emotional trauma he's experiencing is equally important to address. That's why I decided to call the child helpline. That's a thoughtful decision Shani. We can offer Emmanuel counseling services and provide resources for you as well, so you can better support him during this difficult time. If you'd like, we can arrange a meeting with a local counselor who specializes in cases of domestic violence. Would that be helpful? Yes, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Mwinyimkuu. I really appreciate your help in this matter and will do whatever I can to ensure Emmanuel's safety and well-being.", "entities": [{"start": 49, "end": 59, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 93, "end": 98, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 104, "end": 112, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 154, "end": 156, "label": "AGE"}, {"start": 166, "end": 169, "label": "GENDER"}, {"start": 176, "end": 184, "label": "VICTIM"}, {"start": 465, "end": 471, "label": "PERPETRATOR"}, {"start": 730, "end": 747, "label": "INCIDENT_TYPE"}]}

It's like this dark cloud hangs over me all the time, and no matter what I do, I just can't shake it off. I know this might sound weird, but it feels like something is wrong with my body, not my mind. I understand how you feel, Edina. Depression can sometimes manifest in ways that are hard to explain, and it can feel like a physical burden. But let me assure you, it's important to remember that depression is an illness, just like any other, and there are treatments available. It seems like you might be dealing with a biological predisposition towards depression. Some people have a genetic vulnerability to developing the condition. But please don't worry too much about the cause right now. What matters most is finding help and getting better. Have you talked about your feelings with anyone close to you? A family member, friend, or teacher perhaps? Sometimes sharing our burdens with someone we trust can make a big difference. I haven't told anyone yet. I'm scared they won't understand or that they'll think less of me if they find out. But I know I need help. I just don't know where to start. That's completely normal, Edina. It can be hard to open up about our feelings, especially when we fear judgment or rejection. But remember, reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

From Kasulu, Kigoma, there's a concerned adult named Yahya calling about an 8-year-old child named Shangazi who is going through a tough time due to parental conflicts and custody disputes. It seems the parents are divorcing and it's taking a toll on Shangazi. Yahya shares that he has noticed changes in Shangazi's behavior - he's become more withdrawn, anxious, and sad lately. He mentions that the child often cries himself to sleep at night and has stopped playing with his friends. Yahya is worried about Shangazi's emotional well-being and is reaching out for guidance on how best to support him during this challenging time.

Amali further suggests seeking professional help if needed, such as a counselor or therapist who specializes in children and families going through divorce.

Things at home have been tough lately due to parental conflicts, and it's causing a significant amount of financial stress. The tension between his parents is affecting Wasaki deeply, and he feels helpless and anxious. Wasaki has expressed concern about not having enough food or resources for school. He shared that he often goes without meals so his siblings can eat, and he's finding it hard to concentrate in class due to the stress at home. The constant worry is taking a toll on his mental health, and he feels overwhelmed. Wasaki has tried talking to his parents about his concerns, but the conversations usually end up with more arguments instead of solutions. He's afraid to burden them further as they already have so much on their plate, but he needs support to get through this difficult time. Aoko listened empathetically and acknowledged Wasaki's struggles. She reassured him that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and offered some suggestions for coping mechanisms and ways to communicate more effectively with his parents. Aoko also provided resources for local organizations that could offer additional support, such as food banks or counseling services. Aoko encouraged Wasaki to continue reaching out if he needed further assistance and reminded him that it's essential to prioritize his well-being during these challenging times. She emphasized the importance of self-care and encouraged him to find healthy ways to manage his stress, such as exercise or creative activities.

Recently, she has been making strange calls, claiming they are service tests. It's starting to worry me as it's unusual behavior for her. I understand your concern, Jina. Prank calls can sometimes be harmless, but if they continue and escalate, they could potentially cause distress or confusion. Have there been any changes in Edita's life that might be related to this behavior? For example, a new school, moving house, or the loss of someone close to her? No, not that I'm aware of. It started after she got a new mobile phone as a gift. She seemed excited about it at first, but now she's been using it more frequently and sometimes in an unusual manner. The calls she makes are often brief and without any clear purpose. I fear it might be more than just a game. It could be that she's experimenting with her new device or trying to figure out its capabilities. However, if you believe there's more to it, it would be wise to keep an eye on the situation. If Edita continues making such calls and you feel they are causing concern or distress, consider reaching out to her school or local authorities for advice. I appreciate your concern, Sali. I'll keep a close watch on Edita and contact the school if necessary. Thank you for your help. You're doing a great service by being here for people like me. Take care and stay safe.

{"text": "Hi, this is the child helpline. How can I support you today? I'm Hadia from Mkinga, Tanga. There's a concern about my daughter Monika, who's 16 years old. She's been going through a lot of academic pressure lately. The competitive environment at her school has become overwhelming for her. I've noticed that she's been acting differently lately - more stressed and anxious than usual. Her grades have started to suffer, and she often complains about headaches and sleepless nights. It seems like the constant competition is taking a toll on her mental health. Sofia, I'm really worried about Monika. She's always been a bright student, but this new environment has made it difficult for her to thrive. I've tried talking to her about it, but she brushes off my concerns and insists that she can handle it on her own. I understand that academic pressure is common among students, especially in competitive environments. But Monika seems to be struggling more than the rest. I fear that if things don't change soon, she might burn out. What can we do to help her cope with this situation? Are there any resources or support groups available for students dealing with similar issues? I would appreciate any guidance you could offer. Thank you for listening to my concerns. I truly believe that Monika deserves a happy and healthy future, and I'm hoping that your expertise can guide us in the right direction. Sofia, I can hear the concern and empathy in your voice, and I appreciate it. I'll do my best to help Monika navigate through this challenging time. Thank you for taking my call.

Or, if you don't feel comfortable talking to someone you know, there are people here at the helpline who can listen and help. Remember Marwa, it's okay to have bad days, but it's important to reach out for help when things get tough. It's not weak to ask for help, it takes strength.

{"text": "Hi, this is Monica from the child helpline. How can I support you today? Hello, I'm Hala, a 16-year-old girl from Arumeru Magharibi, Arusha. I've been feeling overwhelmed with school work and the competitive environment at my high school. It's becoming too much to handle. I understand how you feel, Hala. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel this way? Well, there are some students who always seem to excel in everything, and I try my best but it feels like I'm not good enough. They make jokes about my grades and I struggle to keep up. My teachers expect a lot from us, and they compare us often. It makes me feel anxious and stressed all the time. I'm sorry to hear that, Hala. It's important to remember that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay not to excel in everything. Have you talked to your teachers about this? They might be able to offer some support or adjustments to help alleviate some of the pressure. I have tried talking to my teachers, but they don't seem to understand how hard it is for me. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of expectations and no one seems to care about my well-being. That must be very frustrating, Hala. It's important to find someone who can listen and offer support during difficult times.

Can you tell me more about what they're doing or saying to make you feel this way? Well, they constantly compare our grades and mock those who aren't as good as them. I've been struggling with my studies lately, and it's really affecting my self-confidence. I feel embarrassed and anxious every time we have a test. That sounds very difficult, Sofia. It's important to remember that everyone learns at their own pace and no one should be made to feel inferior for not understanding things as quickly as others. I know it might be hard, but try to focus on your own progress rather than comparing yourself to others. If you find certain subjects challenging, seek help from your teachers or tutors. They're there to support you. It's also crucial to maintain a positive mindset and not let the bullying affect your overall enjoyment of learning. That's great advice, Sofia.

Her employer expects her to work long hours and doesn't pay her for her labor. I'm really sorry to hear that Adela is going through this.

It's important to take such concerns seriously. Can you share some specific details about what's been happening with Jonathan? Well, he's been coming home with bruises and scratches that I can't explain. He's become withdrawn and afraid to talk about his day. Yesterday, I found him crying in his room with a swollen lip. When I asked him what happened, he said it was an accident but it seemed unlikely. I understand your concern, Maimuna. The signs you've described are indeed alarming. It's crucial that we take steps to ensure Jonathan's safety. Have you spoken to anyone else about this, such as a family member or school teacher? No, I haven't. I was hesitant to bring it up because of the stigma surrounding these issues in our community. But I can't ignore the signs any longer. What should I do next? Firstly, Maimuna, it's important that you document any physical evidence you find on Jonathan. Photographs could serve as valuable evidence if a report needs to be made.

She has been making prank calls to family members and friends, trying to get their attention. It's not like her at all, and it seems to be escalating. I understand your concern, Iman. Prank calling can often be a sign of attention-seeking behavior, especially in younger children. Have you tried talking to Shakira about it? Letting her know that her actions are causing worry and concern for those around her may help her understand the impact she's having on others. I have discussed this with her already, but it seems to be continuing. I want to make sure she gets the help she needs. What can I do next? In cases like these, it's important to provide additional support and guidance for both Shakira and yourself as well.

A teacher, social worker, or even a neighbor might be able to offer guidance and resources. It's important to remember that you are not alone, and there are people who care about your wellbeing. I understand it can be difficult to talk to someone face-to-face, but it may provide the support you need during this challenging time. If you don't feel comfortable approaching someone directly, we can help you make a plan for reaching out anonymously or through trusted intermediaries.

You see, there's a teacher at my school who seems to treat the boys differently than the girls. He's always harsh with us, but he treats the girls gently, even when they misbehave. It doesn't feel fair, Faith. I understand how you feel, Emmanuel. Institutional gender bias can be upsetting and unfair.

I spoke to a few friends about it, but they didn't seem too interested. I don't want to cause any trouble for myself or make things worse at school. What should I do now? One option is to speak with the school principal or another trusted adult about your concerns. It might also be helpful to gather evidence of the teacher's behavior towards you and the girls, such as notes from classmates or witnesses. If that feels too risky, you could consider writing an anonymous letter or speaking with a counselor or social worker at school. I'll think about those options, Faith.

Additionally, breaking down larger assignments into smaller, manageable chunks can make them feel less daunting. Secondly, it's important to take breaks when studying to avoid burnout. Short breaks every hour or so can help you maintain focus and productivity throughout the day. It's also crucial to engage in activities that you enjoy during your downtime, as", "entities": [{"start": 48, "end": 51, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 76, "end": 82, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 96, "end": 100, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 104, "end": 106, "label": "AGE"}, {"start": 116, "end": 123, "label": "PERPETRATOR"}, {"start": 324, "end": 328, "label": "VICTIM"}, {"start": 401, "end": 418, "label": "INCIDENT_TYPE"}]}

Naima has been working at the factory for nearly a year now. She starts early in the morning and finishes late at night, with only short breaks in between. The work is hard, and she's not being paid enough. Her parents agreed to it because they are struggling financially, but Naima wants out. I understand that you want to go back to school and have a normal childhood, Naima. That's what every child deserves. I will do everything I can to help you. In the meantime, can you try to find any evidence or witnesses who could support your case against the factory? Naima is scared to speak up because she fears retaliation from her employer and her parents. But she's determined to make a change. She will try to gather as much information as possible, such as photos of the factory, proof of her work hours, and testimonies from other children working there.

You see, all my friends seem to be doing so much better than me, and my teachers expect a lot. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I understand how you feel, Hadithi. It can be overwhelming when we compare ourselves with others, especially our peers. But remember, everyone has their own pace in learning. It's okay to take time to understand and grasp concepts. But what if I don't catch up? What if I can't meet their expectations? What if I fail? Those thoughts are scary, I know. But let's try to focus on the solution instead of the problem. How about we discuss some strategies to help you manage your studies better? That sounds good, Rahel. Thank you for listening. I appreciate it. Yes, I would like that. Can we start with studying in a quiet place? I usually study in my room, but there's so much noise from outside... maybe a library could be better? Studying in a quiet environment can indeed help focus more on your studies. And that's not all! Breaking down subjects into smaller parts and setting realistic goals for each day can also make things seem less overwhelming. Would you like to try this approach, Hadithi? Yes, I think that would be helpful. Thank you so much, Rahel.

I'm afraid to tell anyone because I fear he'll beat me even worse. I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, Hadithi.

Well, not exactly threatening but they're pretty mean. They play loud music on my phone during classes and pretend to be someone else when I answer. It's embarrassing when my teachers have to ask me to turn off my phone because of their pranks. I see. That sounds quite distressing, Angelina. Have you talked to your siblings about how you feel? Sometimes talking things out can help resolve conflicts. I tried talking to them but they just laugh it off and continue doing it. I don't know what to do anymore. They even started prank calling my friends too. It sounds like this is really affecting not only your school life, but also your personal relationships.

Natron, you don't understand how much I wish I could feel normal again. I used to love going out with my friends, laughing, playing, but now I can barely bring myself to leave the house. I just want to hide away and pretend this isn't happening to me. I know I should talk to someone about it, but I'm afraid of what they might say or think. My school counselor once told me that maybe I was just seeking attention, and that hurt more than anything. But I can't ignore these feelings anymore. They're consuming me from the inside out. I've read about depression online, but it all seems so complex and overwhelming. I don't know where to start or who to turn to. Can you help me understand what's happening to me? Can you help me find a way out of this darkness? Natron, thank you for listening to me. It means more than you can ever imagine. I feel a little better knowing that there's someone out there who cares and wants to help. I'm not giving up yet. I want to fight this thing inside me and regain control of my life.

School has been stressful lately because of my parents' high expectations. They always push me to excel academically, but it's becoming too much. I understand, Bora. It's important for parents to support their children in their studies, but it's equally important that they don't put too much pressure on them. How are you feeling about all this? Are you finding it hard to keep up or are you feeling overwhelmed? I feel overwhelmed most of the time. There are days when I just want to give up, but I can't because I know my parents will be disappointed. I hate letting them down. It makes me sad and anxious all the time. I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, Bora. It's not fair for your parents to expect perfection from you, especially at such a young age. You need time to grow and learn, just like every other child. Have you talked to them about how you feel? No, I haven't. I'm afraid they won't understand or believe me. I think they might get angry if I tell them I can't handle it all. What should I do? First of all, Bora, I want you to know that it's okay to ask for help when things get tough. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you need support. I suggest you sit down with your parents and have an honest conversation about how you feel. Let them know that their expectations are causing you stress and affecting your well-being.

I have, but they just get angry and tell me that I need to listen to them more. I feel like they don't care about how I feel. I'm sorry to hear that, Saidi. It's important for parents and children to communicate openly with each other.

I have a concern about my 11-year-old neighbor, Amri. Recently, I noticed some unusual changes in him and I fear he might be involved in human trafficking. Oh, Asha, that's very concerning. Could you share more details about what made you think so? Well, for the past few weeks, Amri has been absent from school without any proper reason provided by his family. When I tried to talk to him at home, he seemed hesitant and scared to discuss anything with me. Yesterday, I saw him leaving our neighborhood very early in the morning and returning late at night, which is unusual for him. I'm really sorry that you have to go through this, Asha. Human trafficking is a serious issue, and it's important to address it promptly. Have there been any signs of physical abuse or injury on Amri? Thankfully, no. But he does seem exhausted and disinterested in his usual activities. I also noticed that he hasn't been playing outside like he used to. Asha, those are clear indicators of possible labor exploitation. Have you contacted the police or any local authorities regarding this matter? No, not yet. I wanted to get more information first and see if there were any other signs before involving the authorities. That's a good approach, Asha. However, it's crucial that we take action as soon as possible to ensure Amri's safety. I will connect you with our local partner organization who specializes in combating human trafficking.

I don't really know what to do. I've started prank calling my friends and their families just to get attention. It feels good for a moment but then I feel guilty afterwards. I'm really sorry to hear that, Msafiri. It sounds like you might be feeling lonely or misunderstood. Can you tell me more about why you think you need attention? Well... at home, my parents are always busy with work and they don't have much time for me. And at school, I don't have many friends either. So when I make those calls and people get upset or react, it makes me feel important for a while. But then the guilt kicks in. It's completely normal to want attention and connection with others, especially during your teenage years. It's also understandable that you may be feeling neglected by your parents and peers. However, it's important to remember that prank calls can hurt others and damage relationships. Would you like to explore some healthier ways to cope with these feelings? Yes, I'd really like that. What can I do instead? One option could be finding activities or hobbies that you enjoy and connecting with others who share similar interests. This could help you build new friendships and feel a sense of belonging. Another idea is talking openly with your parents about how you're feeling, and maybe even suggesting ways they can spend more quality time together. I like those ideas. I have a friend who loves playing soccer just like me, so we could start practicing together.

I've noticed he's been neglecting himself physically and it's causing me great worry. His clothes are often dirty, he doesn't eat enough, and I've found him shivering at night with no blanket. I understand your concern, Luciana. It sounds like Barke may be experiencing physical neglect. It's crucial to address this issue as soon as possible to ensure his well-being. Have you talked to Barke about what you've noticed? How did he respond? I have, but he seems indifferent and dismissive. He tells me I'm overreacting, but I can see the signs with my own eyes. I just don't know what to do. It can be challenging when a child doesn't want to discuss their problems. However, it's important to keep trying and find ways to open up the conversation. You could try approaching him with empathy and understanding instead of anger or accusations. Express your concern for his health and well-being, and let him know you're there to support him. Thank you, Doreen. I'll do that. But what if he still doesn't listen? Should I take more drastic measures? It's important not to jump to drastic measures without first trying other options. If speaking with Barke directly isn't working, consider involving a trusted third party such as a teacher, school counselor, or local social worker. They may be able to help mediate the conversation and offer additional resources for support. I appreciate your advice, Doreen.

I would recommend changing the phone number if possible, or at least blocking the unknown caller.

It's crucial we educate Zakia about online safety and the importance of not sharing personal information with strangers over the phone or internet.

Remember, it's essential to have open conversations with Zakia about this issue, reassuring her that she is loved and cared for. If she feels comfortable discussing the calls with you, encourage her to talk about her feelings and help her come up with strategies to cope with the situation.

She has been acting strangely lately and I fear she might be in trouble. Last night, around 9 PM, I received an unusual call. It was Ashura's number, but when I answered, there was laughter on the other end. They hung up immediately after, and I believe it may have been a prank call or perhaps testing a service. But given her current state, I can't help but worry. I know it might seem insignificant, but considering everything else, this incident has only added to my concerns. Ashura is usually a responsible and thoughtful girl, but lately, she's been distant and quiet. Her grades have dropped, and she seems preoccupied all the time. Is it possible that this could be related to her behavior? I want to help her, Upendo, but I don't know how. She might not open up easily, but I need to find a way to reach out to her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I understand your concerns, Ajali. It's important to remember that even seemingly minor incidents can sometimes have a significant impact on someone, especially when they are already struggling. The call could be a cry for help or simply a prank gone wrong, but it's worth investigating further. Firstly, try talking to Ashura about the call and express your concerns. Approach her with empathy and without judgment. Let her know that you're there for her and that she can trust you.

{"text": "Hello, this is the child helpline. How can I assist you today? I'm Zaramo from Sumbawanga Vijijini, Rukwa. There's a concern regarding Mwanangwa, my neighbor's son who is 12 years old. He lives alone since his parents are often away for work and he hasn't been attending school regularly. I've noticed that he appears unkempt and sometimes looks hungry. I've tried approaching the family about this, but they seem indifferent or unaware of Mwanangwa's situation. It breaks my heart to see a child suffering like this, Ngonepe. He deserves better care and support. Do you have any suggestions on how I can help him? I understand your concern, Zaramo. Supervisory neglect can have serious consequences for a child's well-being. It's crucial that we find a solution for Mwanangwa as soon as possible. Firstly, it may be beneficial to reach out to local social services or other organizations dedicated to helping children in need. They might be able to provide resources or assistance for Mwanangwa and his family. Secondly, you can also speak with Mwanangwa's teachers at school to express your worries about his absenteeism and overall well-being. Teachers often have a mandate to report such issues to the proper authorities. Lastly, I would recommend keeping a record of any instances where you observe signs of neglect or distress in Mwanangwa. This evidence could prove valuable if it's needed in any future investigations or interventions.

My parents... they don't take me to a doctor when I get sick. They just give me traditional medicine and tell me to rest. It's been happening for a while now, and I think it's getting worse. I see, Belinda. That must be really scary. It's important that children receive proper medical care when they need it. Have you told your parents about your concerns? No, I haven't. They get angry when I talk about things like this. They say I'm being dramatic and that I should just accept their way of doing things. But I don't think it's right. I've missed school because of my health and I'm falling behind. I understand, Belinda. It can be difficult to talk about these issues with your parents, but it's important for them to know how you're feeling and what's happening. Have you considered talking to a trusted adult, like a teacher or another family member, about your situation? I have thought about that, but I don't know if they would listen. My teachers are busy and my aunts and uncles don't really understand the situation. I feel trapped and alone. It sounds like you're in a difficult position, Belinda.

First, we need to report the online bullying to the platform where it's happening. Most platforms have reporting tools that allow you to flag inappropriate behavior. It's also important to block the people who are bullying you. That way, they can't keep hurting you. And remember, it's not your fault. They're the ones being cruel, not you.

He's 11 years old and recently transferred to a new school. I fear he might be facing gender-based violence due to institutional bias. I've noticed that his demeanor has changed since joining the new school. He used to be outgoing but now he's quiet, withdrawn, and frequently cries. His teachers often single him out for harsh punishment compared to other students. It feels like they don't value his education as much because he's a boy. Buyu mentioned that some of the male teachers joke about his 'feminine' qualities and make derogatory comments in front of other students. I've tried speaking with them, but they dismiss my concerns. I fear for Buyu's emotional well-being and safety if this continues. I understand how difficult it can be to witness such situations, Basilisa. It's important to remember that every child deserves a safe and supportive learning environment. I'll do my best to help you navigate this situation. Firstly, I'd recommend documenting each incident with dates, times, and any witnesses if possible. This will be useful when bringing your concerns to school authorities. Also, try reaching out to other parents or community leaders who may also have experienced similar issues. Strength in numbers can help bring about change. Additionally, I encourage you to speak directly with Buyu about his feelings. Let him know that he's not alone and that you're there for him.

I feel like the expectations are too high, and I fear I won't be able to meet them. It's normal to have concerns about your future, but it's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique. Let's focus on managing your current stressors first, and then we can work towards building a plan for your future.

I recently started my first relationship, but things aren't going well. We have a small misunderstanding and it's causing problems between us. I'm really sorry to hear that you're having trouble in your relationship, Halima. Relationships can be complicated at any age, especially the first one. Can you tell me more about what happened?

Now, he's not speaking to me and I don't know how to make things right again. I miss spending time with him and I feel lost without him in my life.

I fear he might be under too much academic pressure. I noticed that he's been struggling with perfectionism recently, always striving for the best grades and scores, even when it starts affecting his health and well-being. He barely sleeps at night and eats very little due to the constant worry about schoolwork. It's heartbreaking to see him so stressed out over academics. I've tried talking to him but he gets defensive, saying that I don't understand how important it is for him to excel. I understand your concerns, Adelina. It sounds like Nasser might be dealing with a lot of pressure from himself and perhaps others as well. Perfectionism can be quite overwhelming, especially at such a young age. Let me share a few suggestions on how we can approach this situation. Firstly, it's essential to ensure that he understands the importance of self-care in balancing academic life and personal health. Encouraging him to prioritize sleep, eat well, and take breaks when needed is crucial. Secondly, I recommend discussing realistic expectations with Nasser about his grades and performance. Setting achievable goals can help reduce stress levels and prevent burnout.

I think it might be depression. My parents have noticed changes in my behavior too. They say I've become less social, lost interest in things I used to enjoy, and sleep a lot more than usual. I'm sorry to hear that Severina. Depression can indeed affect people in various ways. Have you felt this way for a long time or is it recent? It's been going on for about six months now. At first, I thought it was just stress from school and family issues, but it hasn't gotten any better even after things have improved. That's concerning, Severina. It sounds like you might be struggling with a biological predisposition towards depression. Do you have any family history of mental health issues? Actually, yes. My grandmother suffered from depression and my aunt too. I guess that's why I didn't think much about it when I started feeling this way. That's understandable, Severina. It's important to remember that having a family history doesn't mean you're destined to struggle with the same issues. But it does suggest that you might be more susceptible to depression. Have you considered speaking to a mental health professional about this? I haven't yet. I was scared and didn't know where to start, but after reading about my grandmother and aunt's experiences, I realized I need help too. That's a big step, Severina.

Child labor is against the law here in Tanzania. But what can I do? My family needs money to survive. My parents lost their jobs a few months ago, and... I feel like I have no choice.

First of all, let's report this issue to the authorities. We can contact the Labor Inspectorate, and they will investigate this matter for you. It might take some time, but it's important that they know about your situation. I'll also connect you with local child welfare organizations in Singida who may be able to provide additional support or resources. Sina, remember that it's not your fault.

However, it's unfortunate that she responded harshly. Let's discuss some strategies to help you feel more comfortable asking for help and managing your anxiety around schoolwork. We can also explore ways to communicate with your teacher about how you're feeling. I can provide my mother's phone number if that would be helpful. She is Mrs. Mwakagongo, and her number is 07695 403055. I think it would help if she knew what I'm going through so she can offer support as well.

Well, I'm doing okay in math and science but reading and writing are difficult for me. I tried talking to my teacher once, but she just said I should try harder. My parents don't really understand either - they think I'm just lazy or not paying attention. I'm sorry to hear that, Saidi. It sounds like you might have an undiagnosed learning disability.

But if there's someone who can help me find them or even talk to a professional about my situation, that would mean the world to me. Do you know anyone who might be able to assist? I do have some contacts in Singida who specialize in helping children with learning disabilities. I can connect you with them if you'd like.

He's been having trouble maintaining his health due to limited resources and lack of understanding about his condition in our community. I appreciate your concern, Regina. It's important that we take good care of our loved ones, especially those with special dietary needs like your brother. Can you tell me a bit more about the challenges you're facing? Are there any specific issues you've come across in finding appropriate food for him? Well, it's been difficult to find gluten-free food items here in Lindi. The local stores usually stock limited options and they can be quite expensive. Additionally, some family members and neighbors have expressed confusion about his condition, which has led to accidental contamination of his meals on occasion. I'm worried that this could lead to long-term health complications for him if we don't find a solution soon. I understand your concerns, Regina. It can be frustrating and overwhelming when dealing with such challenges. Have you reached out to any local organizations or support groups that may be able to help? Perhaps there are resources available in Lindi that I'm not aware of. As a matter of fact, I have tried contacting the Town Hall and some non-profit organizations here in Lindi, but with little success so far.

It might be worth speaking to them again, but try to approach it from a different angle. Instead of talking about your feelings directly, ask them what they think about spending some quality time together, or discuss something you both enjoy doing. I see your point Lidia.

Can you tell me more about what's been bothering you? You don't have to go through this alone. She explains that it all started with a series of personal setbacks and academic pressures at school. The stress has built up over time, making it hard for her to focus or enjoy anything. Her teachers noticed a change in her behavior and suggested she reach out for help. I understand how overwhelming this can feel, Jema. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. I want you to know that it takes courage to seek help, and you've taken an important step by reaching out today. Jema is afraid of disappointing her family and friends if she asks for help. She worries about the stigma surrounding mental health in her community. I can relate to those feelings; seeking support can feel daunting, but remember that acknowledging your struggles is a sign of strength, not weakness. I'd like to offer you some suggestions on how we can work together to address this issue. First, it would be beneficial for Jema to talk with her family about what she's going through. They might be more understanding than she thinks and willing to support her through this difficult time. In addition, I recommend connecting Jema with a mental health professional who can provide her with additional resources and guidance tailored to her needs. This could help her develop coping strategies to manage", "entities": [{"start": 46, "end": 53, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 82, "end": 96, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 108, "end": 112, "label": "GENDER"}, {"start": 119, "end": 123, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 143, "end": 147, "label": "INCIDENT_TYPE"}, {"start": 162, "end": 164, "label": "AGE"}, {"start": 289, "end": 293, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 764, "end": 768, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 930, "end": 934, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1561, "label": "NAME"}]}

Lately, I've been making prank calls to my friends and neighbors. It's just for attention, I guess, because there's not much else going on at home. I understand that you might be feeling bored or lonely, Zakia. Making prank calls can seem like a fun way to pass the time, but it can upset others and potentially lead to consequences. Have you considered other ways to connect with people or engage in activities that bring you joy? There's a Main Road near my house where some of my friends often hang out after school. I was thinking about joining them more frequently, as it helps pass the time and I enjoy their company. What do you think about that idea, Samira? That sounds like a positive step forward, Zakia! Engaging in activities with supportive friends can help reduce feelings of boredom and loneliness. It's important to remember, however, that our actions should not negatively impact others. Let's discuss some ways you can reach out to your friends without resorting to prank calls. Maybe you could send them a message or give them a call when you know they're available and willing to chat? That way, everyone feels respected and heard, which can help strengthen friendships. Additionally, have you thought about joining any clubs or groups at school that align with your interests? This could provide another outlet for making connections and finding enjoyment.

Dora is having trouble concentrating at school because of the stress and anxiety she feels every day. She has missed several exams due to her father's condition and fears that this will impact her future education opportunities. I can see why you are concerned, Dora.

It's important to know that if the situation escalates and becomes dangerous for Dora or anyone in her household, she can always return to the police station for further assistance. Are there any support systems available for Dora? Friends, family members, teachers, or counselors who could offer guidance and emotional support during this challenging time? Dora shared that she feels isolated and afraid to speak openly about her problems with anyone outside of school due to fear of judgment or repercussions.

But I also wanted to reach out because I've been feeling this way for quite some time now, and I need someone to talk to outside of my immediate circle. That sounds like a great step, Sophia. It can be helpful to have multiple sources of support when dealing with difficult emotions. In addition to speaking with your counselor at school, have you considered seeking help from a mental health professional? They can provide strategies and tools to help manage your feelings, and it's always good to have additional resources available. I appreciate your advice, Conrad.

It's about school and my parents always pushing me to be perfect. They expect nothing but the best grades, and it's becoming too much for me. I feel like I can't make mistakes or disappoint them. Even when I try to talk about it, they just get upset and tell me to focus more. I don't know what to do.

I have a friend named Anna who goes to the same school, and she's been going through the same thing. We often meet near St. Mary's Church after school, and we talk about our problems. It helps a bit, but it still feels like there's no solution in sight. I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, Sofia. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure.

But recently, she started hanging out with a new group of friends from Central Market. They seem like a bad influence on her, and I feel like she's slowly drifting away from our friendship. Yesterday, she told me something that really hurt me. She said she'd been telling those new friends about some secrets I shared with her, and they were laughing about it. I can't believe she would do that to me. I don't know what to do now. I feel so betrayed and don't want to talk to her anymore, but at the same time, I miss our old friendship.

Sometimes people make mistakes and act out of character, but that doesn't mean they don't care or value the friendship anymore. It might help to talk to her about your feelings and ask if she understands how hurtful her actions were. If she truly regrets what happened, she should be willing to work with you to repair the trust between you two. On the other hand, if her apology doesn't seem sincere or if she continues to behave in a way that hurts you, it might be better to distance yourself from this friendship for a while.

It's good that you're with a friend, Rebeca. But please don't contact the woman or agree to meet her again. Instead, let us help you find a safe way back home.

A few days later, she stopped talking to me altogether. I tried reaching out several times but she always ignored me. That sounds tough, Dina. It's important to communicate openly in situations like these. Have you tried discussing the issue with her directly? I did try talking to her once, but it didn't go well. She told me that I let her down and that I wasn't a real friend. That really hurt. I know I made a mistake by not finishing our project, but I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. I can see how you might feel upset about the situation, Dina. It's possible your friend is upset about the project too. People sometimes react strongly when they feel let down or betrayed. Have you considered apologizing and seeing if you two can find a solution together? I suppose I could try that. I just don't want to come off as weak or clingy. Do you have any suggestions on how I should approach her?

They can provide strategies and resources to manage the workload better and reduce your anxiety levels. Secondly, try to find time for relaxation and activities you enjoy outside of schoolwork. Engaging in hobbies can help alleviate stress and improve your overall well-being. Lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help when things get tough. You don't have to carry this burden alone.

Perhaps she could engage in activities like drawing, writing, or playing a musical instrument. This can help her process her emotions and feel more at peace.

I've been struggling to afford educational materials like textbooks and stationery. My parents work on farms, and it's been a tough year due to drought. We barely have enough food, let alone money for school supplies. I really want to continue my education but I don't know how I can manage without these resources. I understand how challenging this situation must be for you, Azize. It's not uncommon for families in rural areas like yours to face financial hardships, especially during times of drought. Have you reached out to your school or any community organizations for assistance? Some schools have programs to provide materials to students in need, and there might also be local charities that can help. If you don't mind me asking, is there a specific landmark near you where I could potentially find resources or information about such organizations? For instance, I recall hearing about St. Mary's Church in Mbeya being involved with community projects. I appreciate your patience, Azize. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Let's see if we can find some solutions together. Would you be comfortable sharing more details about your location so I can better assist you? If not, that's absolutely fine too.

First, I'd recommend seeking medical attention for his injuries if he hasn't already. Second, it might be beneficial for Zaramo to speak with a counselor or psychologist who specializes in post-conflict recovery. They can provide him with the tools and support needed to cope with his feelings and work towards healing. Third, I encourage you to continue showing your support and encouragement.

I was scared they wouldn't believe me or that they would make things worse. But you think they could help? Yes, Russom, I do. If you tell a teacher or a counselor at school, they can take action to stop the bullying and provide support for both you and them. It's important that we try to find a solution so you feel safe at school again. Thank you, Mohamed. You're right. I think I should talk to someone about it.

Child labor is a serious issue and it's great that you're reaching out to us. Could you tell me more about where this river bridge is located? This information will help us direct our support effectively. The river bridge is near my house, just across the creek. I often see Shani there, working long hours, especially during the harvest season. He appears tired and stressed when he returns home. I'm really sorry to hear that, Denice. It sounds like Shani might be working under difficult circumstances. In child labor cases, it's crucial to ensure the child's safety and well-being. Can you think of anyone who might be able to help us? A local authority or someone in the community who can support our efforts? I believe there is a local school teacher named Jamal who lives nearby. He might have some influence in the community. I could talk to him about Shani's situation and ask for his assistance. That way, we can try to find solutions together. That's an excellent idea, Denice. By working with someone like Mr. Jamal, we can create a network of support around Shani and ensure that he is protected from child labor.

Secondly, encourage Ibada to talk about his feelings and try to create a safe space for him to express himself.

She attends school nearby and lately, she's been dealing with bullying at school. It seems the physical bullying has escalated near the River Bridge during lunch break. I worry for her wellbeing and I was hoping to find some guidance on how to help her. Have you dealt with similar situations before? Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about Hekima. That sounds like a very distressing situation. Physical bullying is not acceptable under any circumstances, especially in a school environment where children should feel safe and secure. It's important that we take steps to address this issue immediately. Could you tell me more about the nature of the bullying she's experiencing? Are there specific students involved or does it seem like a larger problem at the school? In addition, is Hekima comfortable discussing this with you directly or would she prefer talking to someone else such as a trusted teacher or counselor? We want to ensure she feels supported during this difficult time. I understand that this can be an emotional topic for both you and Hekima, but it's crucial we take action to protect her from further harm. If there are any teachers or school officials who may have noticed the bullying, or if there are other adults in the community who could potentially help, would it be possible to involve them as well? Together, we can work towards finding a solution that will make Hekima feel safe and empowered at school once again. Thank you for reaching out to us for help.

Physical abuse is never acceptable and I want you to know that it's not your fault. Have you told anyone about this? It might be helpful to speak with someone who can help stop the abuse. No, I haven't told anyone. My father has threatened me that if I ever tell anyone, he will make my life even more miserable. I'm scared. I understand your fear, Hala. But please remember that it's important to seek help and protect yourself. Is there someone you trust who could help you? A family member or a teacher perhaps? I don't have anyone to turn to. My mother passed away last year, and my siblings are too young to understand what's happening. I feel all alone. That must be very difficult for you, Hala. But there are people who care about your wellbeing and want to help. Have you considered reaching out to a local social worker or counselor? They can provide support and guidance on how to deal with this situation. I don't know how to find one. My father doesn't let me go anywhere without his permission.

{"text": "Hello, is this the child helpline? Yes, you've reached a counselor here to help. I can see you're calling from Kibondo, Kigoma. Could you tell me why you're seeking assistance today? I'm Rozalia, a 25-year-old woman, and there's a 17-year-old boy named Adin who lives with his family near the Secondary School in our town that I'm deeply concerned about. He's not attending school regularly and I fear he might be experiencing educational neglect. This is quite concerning, Rozalia. It's essential for children to receive an education as it empowers them to have brighter futures. Can you share more details about Adin? Have you noticed any changes in his behavior or demeanor that might indicate he's struggling with schoolwork or social issues? I've observed that Adin seems withdrawn and disengaged, often spending time alone without participating in community activities. His family appears to be preoccupied with their daily subsistence farming work, leaving little time for Adin's educational needs. I believe they might not realize the long-term implications of this neglect on Adin's future prospects. That sounds very troubling, Rozalia. It's crucial to address this issue promptly before it escalates further. I'd like to explore some possible solutions together. Have you spoken with Adin's family about your concerns? If so, how did they react? Yes, I have. They seem unaware of the gravity of the situation and don't see the importance of education for Adin's future. I tried explaining the long-term effects educational neglect could have on his life, but they didn't seem to understand or care much.

But it's not just at school, I also get cyberbullied on social media platforms. They post hurtful comments and images, and it's constant, day and night. I know it sounds scary, but I've tried to ignore them. However, the recent incidents have left me feeling very low and helpless. I'm losing sleep over it, and my grades are suffering.

{"text": "Hello, is this the child helpline? Yes, this is Hilda, I'm here to help. Hi, my name is Johnson, and I'm calling about a child named Raha from Namtumbo, Ruvuma. She's only 6 years old, and she's been running away from home a lot lately. I'm really worried about her safety. That sounds like a serious issue, Johnson. Can you tell me more about what's been happening with Raha? Well, it all started when she made friends with some older kids in the neighborhood. They've been influencing her to run away from home and go on adventures with them. I've tried talking to her about the dangers of running away, but she just won't listen. It's understandable that you're concerned about Raha's well-being. Peer influence can be a powerful thing, especially for young children. Have you tried talking to her friends' parents or involving the local authorities? I haven't spoken to her friends' parents yet, but I did report her as missing to the local police. They're doing their best to search for her, but I'm still worried she might get into trouble. It's good that you've taken steps to involve the authorities. In the meantime, it's important to continue communicating with Raha and letting her know that you care about her safety. Encouraging her to make better choices and setting boundaries with her friends may also help prevent future incidents. Thank you, Hilda. I'll keep trying to reach out to Raha and make sure she knows she can always come to me if she needs help. I appreciate your support and advice. You're welcome, Johnson.

But what if things don't get better at home? It's good to have a plan, Jordan. If things don't improve, you can always reach out to the child helpline for support. We're here to listen and help you through difficult situations. Remember, there are people who care about your well-being and want to help you. Thank you, Ghubari.

I've been having some trouble with my studies and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry to hear that, Azize. Can you tell me more about the difficulties you're facing with your studies? Well, I've always found it hard to focus in class and remember things. I struggle to read and write, and it takes me longer to understand things compared to my classmates. It sounds like you're experiencing some learning difficulties, Azize. Have you ever been tested for any learning disabilities? No, I haven't. My parents think I'm just lazy and not trying hard enough, but I know there's something more going on. It's important to remember that learning disabilities are real and not a result of laziness. Have you talked to your teachers or school counselor about your struggles? I've tried, but they don't seem to understand. I feel like I'm falling behind and it's affecting my self-esteem. I understand how frustrating that must be, Azize. It's important to seek help and support for your learning difficulties. I can provide you with resources and guidance on how to get tested for learning disabilities. Thank you, Bali. I really appreciate your help.

I don't want to make things worse. It's important to remember that this is not your fault, Catherine. No one deserves to be in a situation where they feel unsafe.

We are here to support you. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and you deserve to be safe and protected. Is there a safe place you can go to, like a neighbor or a friend's house? I think I can go to my friend's house. They live nearby. That's a good idea, Catherine. It's important to prioritize your safety. Remember, you can always call us back if you need more support or advice. You are not alone in this. Thank you, Busu. I feel a little better now that I've talked to someone about it. I'm glad I could help, Catherine. Remember, you deserve to feel safe and happy. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the one one six. This is Fanana speaking, how can I assist you today? Hello Fanana, my name is Zahara. I am 52 years old and I am calling from Unguja Kaskazini B, Kaskazini Unguja. I am concerned about a child in my community named Jeni. She is only 6 years old and she has been missing school frequently. Oh, I see. Can you tell me more about Jeni and why she is missing school? Well, Jeni comes from a very poor family. Her parents struggle to make ends meet and she often has to help them with chores instead of going to school. They live near the Bus Stand and her parents cannot afford to buy her school supplies or uniforms. They believe it is better for Jeni to stay home and help them earn some money. That is a difficult situation for Jeni. Every child has the right to education. Have you spoken to Jeni's parents about the importance of schooling? Yes, I have tried to talk to them, but they are struggling financially and they see Jeni's help as a necessity. I feel helpless and I want to find a solution to help Jeni continue her education. Thank you for reaching out, Zahara. It is important that we address this issue as soon as possible. I will connect you with our team who can provide support and resources for Jeni and her family.

That's a very important question, Peter. It's great that you're seeking information to stay safe and healthy. One way to protect yourself and your partner is by using condoms during sexual activity. Condoms not only help prevent pregnancies but also reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Okay, thank you for that information. Is there anything else I should know about reproductive health? It's also important to communicate openly with your partner about your sexual health and boundaries.

Malnutrition is a serious issue that can have long-term effects on a child's health. Have you talked to your friends about their eating habits? Yes, I've tried to talk to them, but they don't seem to think it's a big deal. They just eat whatever they can get, even if it's not healthy. It's important to have a balanced diet to stay healthy, especially at your age. Do you know if there are any programs or resources in your community that can help your friends with their nutrition? I'm not sure, but I know that our primary school sometimes has sessions about healthy eating. Maybe I can talk to our teachers about organizing more of those sessions. That's a great idea, Emma.

That sounds really concerning, Adin. It's important for us to address issues like this. It sounds like you might be talking about human trafficking. Yes, that's what I heard. They mentioned something about girls being forced to do things they don't want to do. It's really brave of you to speak up about this, Adin. Human trafficking, especially sex trafficking, is a serious issue that we need to address. Can you provide me with more details about what you heard? They were saying that the girls are promised jobs in the city, but then they end up being forced into doing bad things. They said some of the girls are as young as me. I'm so sorry to hear that, Adin. It's not right for anyone, especially children, to be put in those situations. We will do everything we can to help. Can you tell me if you know who is involved in this trafficking? I didn't hear any names, but I can try to find out more information and let you know. That would be very helpful, Adin.

It's important to address issues like school dropouts and truancy. Can you provide me with more information about Ajali's situation? Well, Ajali comes from a low-income family and her parents are struggling to provide for her. Due to financial difficulties, they are unable to support her education, which has led to Ajali feeling disconnected from the school system. I understand the challenges Ajali is facing. It's unfortunate that many children in similar situations are forced to drop out of school. As a community, we need to come together to support these children and ensure they have access to education. Exactly, Fernando. I believe that every child deserves the opportunity to receive an education and build a better future. Ajali is a bright young girl, and it would be a shame to see her potential go to waste. I agree, Omar. I will make sure to follow up on Ajali's case and connect her family with the necessary resources and support. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I'm calling from Shinyanga Mjini, Shinyanga. Hello Julius, how are you feeling today? I'm feeling really anxious and stressed out. I can't seem to shake this feeling of worry and fear. I'm sorry to hear that, Julius. Can you tell me more about what's been causing you to feel this way? Well, my parents are going through a divorce and I'm really struggling with the idea of not having them both around all the time. I feel like I'm being pulled in different directions and it's really overwhelming. That sounds like a difficult situation to be in, Julius. It's understandable that you would feel anxious and stressed about your parents' divorce. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling? Not really, I haven't felt comfortable opening up to anyone about it. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel this way and that you're not alone in dealing with these emotions. Have you tried any coping mechanisms to help you manage your anxiety? I've tried taking deep breaths and going for walks, but it only helps temporarily. Those are good strategies, Julius. Have you thought about seeking professional help or talking to a counselor about your feelings? I haven't considered it before, but I think it might be a good idea. Do you know of any resources or places I could go for help in Shinyanga Mjini? Yes, there are counseling services available at the Central Hospital in Shinyanga Mjini that could provide you with the support you need.

Yeah, I didn't really think about that at the time. I just wanted to be funny. It's okay, Mosi. We all make mistakes, but it's important to learn from them.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian child helpline. This is Rabia speaking, how can I assist you today? Hi Rabia, my name is Kajakafwile. I am 29 years old and calling from Namtumbo in Ruvuma. I am worried about a child in my community named Gaudencia. What seems to be the issue with Gaudencia, Kajakafwile? Well, Gaudencia is only 7 years old, but she is being forced to work in the fields to help her family survive. She should be in school, but instead, she is spending long hours laboring in the sun. That is concerning to hear. Child labor is a serious issue that we need to address. Have you spoken to Gaudencia's family about this? Yes, I have tried to talk to them, but they are struggling to make ends meet. They believe that Gaudencia's work is necessary for their economic survival. I understand the difficult situation they are facing, but it is important for children to be protected from such labor. We can provide support and guidance to help Gaudencia and her family find alternative solutions. Have you considered reaching out to local authorities or organizations for assistance? I have not thought about that. Do you have any recommendations on where I can go for help? Yes, there are organizations in Ruvuma that can provide assistance with issues like child labor. You can also visit the District Hospital, where they may have resources and information on how to support children in need. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Kajakafwile.

It's been hurting a lot and I'm worried it might be serious. I'm sorry to hear that, Rabia. It's important to take care of your health, especially when it comes to injuries. Have you seen a doctor or received any medical attention for your ankle? No, I haven't. I was hoping it would get better on its own, but it's been a few days and it's still really painful. I understand, Rabia. It's always best to get injuries checked out by a medical professional to ensure proper care and treatment. Have you talked to your parents or guardians about this? Yes, I told my mom, but she's been really busy with work and hasn't had time to take me to the doctor. I see. In situations like this, it's important to prioritize your health and seek medical attention. Is there a trusted adult or family member who can take you to see a doctor? I think my uncle might be able to take me. I'll talk to him about it. Thank you for your help, Abasi. You're welcome, Rabia.

Well, I feel like I'm not growing as fast as my friends. I see them getting taller and stronger, but I still feel so small. Is there something wrong with me? It's completely normal to have these concerns, Zena. Growth and development can vary from person to person. Have you been eating well and getting enough nutrients? I try to eat as much as I can, but sometimes we don't have enough food at home. My parents work hard, but it's tough to make ends meet. I understand, Zena.

It's not your responsibility to fix your dad's drinking problem, Roza. It's important to remember that you can always reach out for help and support. Have you talked to anyone else about this? No, I haven't. I didn't know who to talk to until I found this helpline number. I'm glad you reached out to us, Roza. You're very brave for speaking up about this. Is there anyone else in your family or community that you trust and feel comfortable talking to? I have an aunt who lives nearby. She's always been very supportive and understanding. Maybe I can talk to her about it. That sounds like a good idea, Roza. It's important to have someone you trust to talk to about your feelings. Remember, you can always call us back if you need more support or advice. You're not alone in this. Thank you, Shabani.

Well, I have noticed that Mzee has been experiencing some rights violations. He is often forced to work long hours in the fields instead of attending school. He is also not given proper meals and is sometimes physically punished by his guardians. I am sorry to hear that, Cornelius. It is important that children like Mzee are able to access their protection rights, including the right to education and a safe environment. Have you tried talking to his guardians about these concerns? Yes, I have tried speaking to them but they do not seem to listen. I am worried about Mzee's well-being and I believe he needs help. I understand your concern, Cornelius. We can definitely assist in this situation. I will make sure to report this case to the appropriate authorities and ensure that Mzee's rights are protected.

It's okay to say no to things that make you uncomfortable or put you at risk. Have you talked to your friends about how you feel? Not really, I'm afraid they'll make fun of me or stop hanging out with me. It's understandable to feel that way, but true friends will respect your boundaries and decisions. It might be helpful to have an honest conversation with them about how you feel. You can also reach out to supportive adults or counselors for guidance. Thank you, Etana.

Bullying and social exclusion can be very difficult for children to deal with. How long has this been going on? It started a few weeks ago.

Has Vincent talked to his teacher or school counselor about what's been happening? Yes, he did. The teacher spoke to the students involved, but the situation hasn't improved much. Vincent still feels lonely and left out. I understand how concerning this must be for you as a parent. Have you talked to Vincent about how he's feeling and what he would like to see happen? Yes, we've had some conversations about it. He just wants to be able to play with his classmates and feel included like everyone else. It's great that you're supporting him through this. We can work together to come up with some strategies to help Vincent feel more accepted at school. Would you like some advice on how to approach this situation? Yes, please.

{"text": "Hello, Child Helpline, this is Hilary speaking. How can I help you today? Hi, my name is Jaqueline, I'm 10 years old and I'm calling from Chake Chake, Kusini Pemba. Nice to meet you, Jaqueline. What seems to be bothering you today? I've been feeling really anxious and stressed lately. I'm sorry to hear that, Jaqueline. Can you tell me more about what's been causing your anxiety and stress? It's mostly because my parents have to travel for work a lot, and I miss them so much when they're gone. I get really worried that something bad might happen to them. That sounds really tough, Jaqueline. It's normal to miss your parents when they're away. I know, but I can't help but feel so scared and alone when they're not here. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling, Jaqueline? Not really. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems. It's important to talk about your feelings, Jaqueline. You're not alone in this. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help you when you're feeling anxious? No, I haven't. What kind of techniques can I try? You could try deep breathing exercises or visualization techniques to help calm your mind. It might also help to talk to a trusted adult about how you're feeling. Thank you, Hilary. I'll try those techniques and talk to my aunt about how I've been feeling. That's a great idea, Jaqueline. Remember, you can always call us if you need someone to talk to.

{"text": "Hello, good afternoon. My name is Fidelis, and I'm calling about a child in need of help. His name is Kafil, he's 11 years old, and he lives in Nzega, Tabora. Hello Fidelis, I'm Mkuu from the child helpline. How can I assist you today regarding Kafil? Thank you for taking my call, Mkuu. The reason I'm reaching out is because Kafil's educational rights are being denied. He's not able to attend school regularly due to financial constraints in his family. They can't afford to pay for his school fees and other necessary materials. I see, that is indeed a serious issue. Every child has the right to education, and it's concerning to hear that Kafil is being deprived of this fundamental right. Have you tried speaking to his family about this matter? Yes, I have spoken to his family, but unfortunately, they are unable to afford the expenses needed for Kafil to attend school regularly. I believe he has a lot of potential and deserves the opportunity to receive an education. Thank you for sharing this information with us, Fidelis. We will work on finding a solution to ensure that Kafil's educational rights are upheld. In the meantime, I will escalate this issue to our team so we can provide the necessary support and guidance to Kafil and his family. I truly appreciate your assistance, Mkuu. Kafil's future is important, and I believe with the right support, he can achieve great things.

Yes, I have told them that I am tired and sometimes I miss school because of work. But they say we need the money to buy food and pay for school fees.

Hi, my name is Ashura, I'm 39 years old, and I'm calling about a child named Balozi from Bukombe, Shinyanga. Nice to meet you, Ashura. How can I help you with Balozi today? Well, Balozi is 11 years old and has been struggling with school. He's been skipping classes and his grades are dropping significantly. I see, that does sound concerning. Have you tried talking to Balozi about his behavior and academic performance? Yes, I have tried speaking to him, but he seems disinterested in school. He used to enjoy learning, but lately, he's been avoiding going to school altogether. It's important to address this issue as soon as possible to prevent further academic decline. Has Balozi mentioned any specific reasons for his truancy? He mentioned feeling overwhelmed with his schoolwork and not being able to keep up with the lessons. He also mentioned feeling bullied by some of his classmates. It's crucial to address these issues promptly. Have you spoken to the school about Balozi's situation? Yes, I have, but they didn't seem to have a solution. They suggested seeking help from a counselor or a child helpline. I'm glad you reached out to us.

What seems to be the issue with Omar, Peace? Well, lately he has been very withdrawn and sad. He used to be so full of life and energy, but now he barely speaks to anyone and spends most of his time alone in his room. I think he might be struggling with depression.

That must be incredibly difficult for a young girl to handle on her own. Is she receiving any support or assistance from the community? Not really, Petero. The village is aware of Erica's situation, but everyone is struggling to make ends meet themselves.

Well, I've noticed that Hafsa has been missing school quite often lately. Her parents are always busy with work, so they may not be aware of what's going on. I'm concerned that she might be falling behind in her studies. I see. It's important to address this issue before it becomes a bigger problem. Have you tried talking to Hafsa's parents about this? Yes, I have, but they seem to be preoccupied with their work and don't have much time to focus on Hafsa's education. I'm not sure what to do next. It's understandable that Hafsa's parents may have other priorities, but education is crucial for a child's future. Have you thought about reaching out to the school or local authorities for support? I haven't thought of that. Maybe I could visit the school and speak to Hafsa's teachers to see if they have noticed any changes in her behavior or attendance. I could also go to the Town Hall and seek advice from the local authorities on how to address this issue. That sounds like a good plan, Gaudencia. It's important to work together to ensure that Hafsa receives the support she needs to stay in school and succeed academically.

Well, it's about gender-based violence. Frederick is being discriminated against because of his gender. His parents treat him differently from his sisters. They don't allow him to participate in certain activities just because he's a boy. It breaks my heart to see him going through this. I'm sorry to hear that, Joshua. Gender discrimination is a serious issue that can have long-lasting effects on a child's well-being. Have you talked to Frederick's parents about your concerns?

Not really, I feel like they expect me to do well and I don't want to let them down. It's important to communicate your feelings, Stela.

It's important that everyone is treated fairly and equally. Can you give me some examples of the gender bias you've noticed? Well, for one thing, the boys always get chosen first for sports teams and leadership roles, even if the girls are more qualified. And when it comes to punishments, the girls always seem to get harsher punishments for the same things that the boys do. That does sound unfair, Kito. It's important to speak up about these issues so that they can be addressed. Have you tried talking to anyone at your school about this? I've tried talking to my teacher, but she just brushed me off and said that's the way things are. I don't think that's right. I agree, Kito.

What's on your mind today? I've been feeling really lonely lately. My family is always busy with work and I don't have any siblings to play with. I'm sorry to hear that, Eveline. It's important to talk about our feelings. Have you tried talking to your family about how you feel? Yes, but they always say they're too busy to spend time with me. I feel like they don't understand. It sounds like you're feeling isolated and disconnected from your family. It's okay to feel that way, Eveline. You're not alone in feeling lonely sometimes. But what can I do about it? I don't want to feel this way anymore. One thing you can try is finding activities that make you happy and keep you busy. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy? I like drawing and playing with my dolls, but it's not the same as having someone to talk to. That's understandable, Eveline. It's important to find ways to connect with others and build relationships outside of your family. Have you thought about making friends at school or in your community? I've tried, but it's hard for me to open up to new people. I feel like I don't fit in. It's normal to feel that way, Eveline.

Can you tell me more about what's been happening? Yeah, so for example, in our class, the teachers always give more attention and praise to the boys. They get chosen for leadership roles and opportunities, while the girls are often overlooked. It's not fair. That does sound unfair, Seghen. No one should be treated differently because of their gender. Have you tried talking to anyone at school about this issue? I've tried speaking up, but I feel like no one really listens or takes it seriously. I feel like I'm alone in this. You're not alone, Seghen. We are here to support you and help you find a solution. Have you thought about talking to someone in authority at school, like the headteacher or a counselor? I haven't, but maybe I should. I just don't want to cause any trouble. It's important to speak up for what's right, Seghen. Your voice matters, and you deserve to be treated with respect and equality. I can help you come up with a plan on how to approach this issue at school. Thank you, Theresia. I feel better knowing that I have someone to talk to about this.", "entities": [{"start": 67, "end": 72, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 86, "end": 92, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 97, "end": 99, "label": "AGE"}, {"start": 116, "end": 122, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 165, "end": 184, "label": "INCIDENT_TYPE"}, {"start": 57, "end": 60, "label": "GENDER"}]}

Hi, my name is Mwakanjuki, I am 28 years old and I am calling about a child named Akida from Kilolo, Iringa. I believe she might be in danger of human trafficking. Thank you for reaching out, Mwakanjuki. Can you provide me with more details about what makes you think Akida is at risk of human trafficking? Well, I have noticed some suspicious activities happening in our neighborhood. There have been strange people coming and going from Akida's house at odd hours. She has also been seen with older men who do not seem to be her relatives. I am really concerned for her safety. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, Mwakanjuki. It does sound like a serious situation. Human trafficking, especially sex trafficking, is a grave violation of a child's rights. We must take immediate action to protect Akida. Have you noticed any changes in Akida's behavior or any signs that she might be in distress? Yes, Akida has become very withdrawn and secretive lately. She used to be a cheerful and outgoing child, but now she hardly speaks to anyone. I am worried that she might be in trouble and unable to ask for help. Thank you for sharing that information, Mwakanjuki. It is crucial for us to act quickly to ensure Akida's safety. I will alert the authorities and child protection services in Kilolo, Iringa to investigate this matter further. Your quick thinking and concern for Akida's well-being are commendable.

What seems to be the problem? Well, I've been making prank calls to people in my village and I think I need help. I see. Can you tell me more about why you've been making these prank calls? I don't know, I guess I just wanted attention. My parents have been really busy lately and I felt like no one was paying attention to me. It's understandable to want attention, Sheila, but making prank calls isn't the best way to go about it. Have you talked to your parents about how you've been feeling? No, I haven't. I was too scared to tell them. It's important to communicate with your parents about how you're feeling, Sheila. They care about you and want to help. Making prank calls can have consequences and it's important to find healthier ways to seek attention. I didn't think about it that way. I'll try talking to my parents about how I've been feeling.

Nice to meet you, France. How are you feeling today? I'm feeling really lonely and isolated. I live in a rural area of Dodoma, far from the city center. There are not many kids around here to play with, and I often feel like I have no one to talk to. I'm sorry to hear that, France. It must be tough feeling so alone. Have you tried reaching out to any adults in your community for support? Yes, I've talked to my parents about it, but they are always busy with work. I just feel like I'm on my own most of the time. I can understand how that would be difficult, France. Is there any particular reason why you feel lonely in your area? I think it's because I live far from the city center and most of the kids in my neighborhood go to school there. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of things because of where I live. It sounds like the geographic isolation is playing a big role in your feelings of loneliness. Have you tried finding any activities or hobbies that you enjoy to keep yourself occupied? I have tried, but there aren't many options available in my area. There is a mosque nearby where I sometimes go to pray, but other than that, there isn't much to do. I see. It's important to try and find ways to stay connected and engaged, even in a rural area. Have you thought about joining any online communities or clubs to meet new friends? That's a good idea, Frank.

It's been really difficult for both of us. I'm sorry to hear that, Aida. It must be tough for both you and Enzi. Have you noticed any specific triggers for her anxiety? I think the main trigger is when she has to leave me or when she feels like she's going to be alone. She gets very clingy and emotional. It's understandable that she would feel anxious in those situations. Have you tried any techniques to help her cope with her anxiety? I've tried talking to her and reassuring her, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I'm not sure what else to do. Have you considered seeking support from Enzi's school? They may have resources or programs in place to help children with anxiety, especially since she is attending the Secondary School. That's a good idea, I haven't thought of that.

Nice to meet you, Hussein. How can I assist you today? I have a problem with orphaned and abandoned children in my community. There are many kids who have lost their parents or been left by their families. They are living with distant relatives, but the care they receive is not adequate. That sounds like a difficult situation. It's important for these children to be in a safe and supportive environment. Have you tried talking to anyone about this issue? Yes, I have spoken to some of the elders in my village, but they seem overwhelmed with other responsibilities. I don't know where else to turn for help. I understand your concern, Hussein. Have you considered reaching out to the local authorities, like the police station, for assistance? I haven't thought about that. Do you think they could help with this situation? Yes, the police station may be able to provide support or connect you with organizations that specialize in child welfare. It's important to ensure that these children are receiving the care and protection they need. Thank you, Masomakali. I will visit the police station and see how they can help.

Not really, I'm afraid they'll make fun of me or stop hanging out with me. It's understandable to feel that way, but true friends will respect your boundaries and decisions.

We've been searching for him everywhere, but we haven't been able to find him. I'm sorry to hear that, Anyelwiswe. It must be a difficult situation. Have you checked with his friends or any other relatives? Yes, we've reached out to everyone we could think of, but no one has seen him. I'm really worried about his safety. I understand your concern. It's important to act quickly in these situations. Have you informed the authorities about Ambidwile's disappearance? Not yet, but I will do that right away. I just wanted to reach out to you first for some guidance on what steps to take. That's a good idea, Anyelwiswe. It's important to involve the authorities as soon as possible. They can help with the search efforts and ensure Ambidwile's safety. Thank you, Calvin. I will contact the authorities immediately. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? I would also recommend reaching out to the community center in Iringa Mjini. They may have resources and support available to assist in finding Ambidwile. Thank you for the suggestion, Calvin. I will do that right away.

I've tried talking to my teachers, but they just tell me to work harder. My parents are always busy with work, so I don't want to bother them. It's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help, Christopher. Have you considered speaking to a school counselor or seeking extra support outside of school? I haven't thought about that before. Do you think it would be helpful for me to seek additional support? Yes, seeking help from a counselor or a learning support program could provide you with the tools and strategies you need to overcome your learning difficulties. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Thank you, Willy. I will definitely consider reaching out for additional support. I appreciate your guidance and advice. You're welcome, Christopher. Remember, it's important to take care of your mental and emotional well-being.

It's good that you took him to see a doctor. Have you noticed any changes in his behavior or mood recently? Yes, actually. He's been more irritable and withdrawn lately.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian Child Helpline. This is Betina, how can I assist you today? Hi Betina, my name is Mariana. I'm calling about a child named Buyu, he's 9 years old and he's from Liwale, Lindi. Nice to meet you, Mariana. How can I help you with Buyu today? I have some questions about Buyu's feeding practices. I want to make sure he's getting the right nutrition. Of course, that's very important. What specific questions do you have about Buyu's feeding practices? Well, Buyu is a picky eater and I'm struggling to get him to eat balanced meals. Do you have any tips on how to encourage him to eat healthier? I understand your concern. It can be challenging when children are picky eaters. Have you tried involving Buyu in meal preparation or offering him a variety of food choices? Yes, I've tried that but it hasn't been very successful. Buyu tends to just eat the same few things over and over again. It's common for children to have food preferences, but it's important to ensure they're getting the nutrients they need. Have you considered consulting a nutritionist for personalized advice on Buyu's diet? I haven't thought about that, but it sounds like a good idea. Can you recommend any nutritionists in the Liwale area? I can provide you with a list of nutritionists in your area. It's important to seek professional advice to ensure Buyu's nutritional needs are being met.

Hi Salim, my name is Rose, I'm 38 years old and I'm calling about a child named Mwalimu who is 7 years old from Rufiji, Pwani. I'm really worried about him.

Has Mwalimu experienced any significant changes or traumatic events recently that could be contributing to his feelings of depression? Yes, his parents have been going through a difficult divorce, and he has been caught in the middle of their conflicts. He's been witnessing a lot of arguments and tension at home, which I believe is causing him a lot of stress. It's understandable that Mwalimu may be experiencing chronic stress in this situation.

I've tried to speak to my parents, but they say it's just how things are and that I should accept it. But I don't think it's right. I understand your frustration, Warda. Gender discrimination is a serious issue, and it's important to speak up about it. Have you thought about reaching out to any local organizations for support? I haven't, but I will look into it. Thank you for listening to me, Ana. Of course, Warda. Remember, you deserve to be treated equally and have access to education. Don't hesitate to seek help if you need it. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? No, that's all for now. Thank you for your advice, Ana. You're welcome, Warda. Take care of yourself, and remember, you're not alone in this. If you ever need to talk again, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

How can I assist you? I wanted to talk about orphaned and abandoned children in my community. I see so many kids who are struggling without proper care. That's a very important issue, Mwakalinga. Could you tell me more about what you're seeing? Well, there are children who have lost their parents and are left to fend for themselves. Some are living on the streets, others are taken in by relatives who can't provide for them. It's heartbreaking. I can imagine how difficult that must be for both the children and the community. Have you tried reaching out to any local organizations for support? Yes, we have some NGOs that provide temporary help, but many of these children are aging out of care with no long-term solutions. They need more sustainable support. It's great that there are organizations offering temporary assistance, but you're right, there needs to be more long-term solutions in place. Have you spoken to any authorities about this issue? I've tried, but it feels like our voices are not being heard. I want to advocate for these children and make sure they have the support they need to thrive. That's very admirable, Mwakalinga. Your advocacy for these vulnerable children is so important. Have you thought about starting a community initiative or reaching out to larger organizations for support? I've been thinking about it, but I wasn't sure where to start.

It's not her fault that her parents are having conflicts. Have you tried talking to her parents about how their arguments are affecting her? I've tried to talk to them, but they don't seem to listen.

I'm Cecil from the child helpline. What seems to be the issue today? Well, I have some questions about sexual and reproductive health. I've been hearing a lot of things at school and from my friends, and I'm not sure what's true and what's not. I'm glad you reached out to us, Darweshi. It's important to have accurate information about these topics. What specific questions do you have? I've been wondering about puberty and what changes to expect in my body. And also, how do I know if I'm ready for sexual activity? Those are great questions, Darweshi. Puberty is a natural process where your body goes through changes to become an adult. It's normal to experience growth spurts, changes in voice, and the development of sexual characteristics. As for readiness for sexual activity, it's important to understand consent, protection, and emotional readiness before engaging in any sexual activity. Thank you for explaining that, Cecil. I also wanted to ask about contraception and sexually transmitted infections. How can I protect myself from these risks? It's great that you're thinking about protection, Darweshi. Contraception methods like condoms can help prevent both pregnancy and STIs. It's important to always use protection and get tested regularly if you're sexually active.

He's 11 years old and lives in Temeke, Dar es Salaam. Thank you for reaching out, Matilda. What seems to be the issue with Jaali? Well, Jaali has been making prank calls to emergency services and pretending there's a serious situation when there isn't. He's been doing this quite frequently and it's been causing a lot of unnecessary panic and wasting resources. I see, that is definitely a concerning behavior. Have you spoken to Jaali about this issue? Yes, I have tried to talk to him about it, but he doesn't seem to understand the seriousness of his actions. I'm worried that if he continues, it could lead to serious consequences. It's good that you're seeking help for Jaali. It's important to address this behavior before it escalates. Have you noticed any other concerning behaviors from Jaali? Yes, Jaali has also been seeking attention in other ways, such as disrupting class at school and exaggerating stories to get attention from his peers. It sounds like Jaali may be struggling with some underlying issues that are causing him to seek attention in negative ways. I can provide you with some resources and guidance on how to help Jaali address these behaviors. Thank you, I would appreciate any help and advice you can offer.

I didn't know how to bring it up. It's okay, Hellen. You can always talk to a trusted adult or a counselor about how you're feeling. They can help you find better ways to cope with your emotions.

Hello Selemani, I'm Noelia from the child helpline. What seems to be the problem? I have been working at a nearby farm for the past few weeks, and the conditions are really bad. I have to carry heavy loads, work long hours, and sometimes I don't even get paid. I'm sorry to hear that, Selemani. It sounds like you are experiencing hazardous work conditions, which is not safe for someone your age. Have you talked to anyone about this? No, I haven't. I'm afraid that if I speak up, I will lose my job and not be able to help my family. It's important for you to know that child labor is illegal in Tanzania, especially when it involves hazardous work conditions. Your safety and well-being are the top priority. We can help you find a solution without putting you at risk. But what can I do? I need to work to help my family. I understand, Selemani. We can work together to find alternative solutions that will ensure your safety and still support your family. We can connect you with organizations that can provide assistance and guidance in this situation. You are not alone in this. Thank you, Noelia. I didn't know there were people who could help me.

It's important for children to attend school regularly to get a good education. Have you talked to any adults about this problem? I tried talking to my teacher, but she's always busy with other students. My parents are also busy working at the district hospital, so they don't have much time to help me with this. I understand, Omar. It must be tough feeling like you're on your own with this problem. Have you noticed any reasons why your friends are skipping school?

It's concerning that so many children in your community are facing these challenges. Have you thought about talking to a school counselor or social worker about this issue? I didn't think of that.

Hello Jamil, my name is Ambakisye, and I am calling about a child named Msafiri from Bagamoyo, Pwani. He is 17 years old and is feeling very lonely and isolated. I see, thank you for reaching out, Ambakisye. Loneliness and isolation can be very challenging, especially for young people. Can you tell me more about Msafiri's situation? Well, Msafiri lives in a remote village in Bagamoyo, far away from his peers and friends. He doesn't have access to transportation to visit them, and he feels disconnected from the world outside his village. I understand how difficult that must be for Msafiri. Is he able to communicate with anyone, like family members or neighbors? Yes, he lives with his grandmother, but she is elderly and often busy with household chores. Msafiri doesn't have any siblings, and the other children in the village are much younger than him. It sounds like Msafiri is lacking social interaction and companionship, which can definitely contribute to feelings of loneliness. Have you spoken to him about how he's feeling? Yes, I have tried to talk to him, but he seems hesitant to open up about his emotions. I worry about his mental well-being and how isolation is affecting him. I appreciate your concern, Ambakisye.

Well, Florence is only 9 years old, and she's been caught in the middle of her parents' constant conflicts. They argue all the time, and it's really affecting her emotionally.

Hello Asteria, my name is Maimuna, I am 50 years old and I am calling about my child Tumaini. He is 13 years old and we live in Unguja Kaskazini A, Kaskazini Unguja. I am really worried about him lately. What seems to be the matter with Tumaini, Maimuna? He has been feeling very down and sad lately. He doesn't want to talk to anyone, he has lost interest in his favorite activities, and he is always tired. I think he might be depressed. I'm sorry to hear that, Maimuna. It's good that you are reaching out for help. Depression is a serious issue, especially in young children. Have you noticed any triggers or events that may have led to Tumaini feeling this way? Not really, Asteria. Tumaini has always been a sensitive child, and I have heard that depression can also be genetic. I have struggled with depression in the past, so I am worried that he may have inherited it from me. That is a valid concern, Maimuna.

Yes, I have thought about taking him to see a counselor or therapist. I just want him to feel better and be happy again. That's a good step, Maimuna.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian child helpline. My name is Endesha, how can I help you today? Hi, my name is Aziza. I'm 16 years old and I'm calling from Unguja Kaskazini B, Kaskazini Unguja. I have some concerns about my little sister's growth and development. She's not growing as fast as other kids her age and I'm worried about her nutrition. I'm sorry to hear that, Aziza. It's great that you're looking out for your sister. Can you tell me a bit more about her diet and eating habits? Well, she's a picky eater and doesn't like fruits and vegetables much. She mostly eats rice and beans, and sometimes she skips meals because she says she's not hungry. I've tried to talk to my parents about it, but they don't seem to think it's a big deal. It's understandable that you're concerned, Aziza. It's important for children to have a balanced diet to support their growth and development. Have you noticed any other changes in your sister's behavior or health recently? Yes, she seems tired all the time and gets sick more often than before. I'm worried that she's not getting enough nutrients to support her growth. Is there anything I can do to help improve her diet and nutrition? I can provide you with some information and tips on how to encourage your sister to eat a more balanced diet. It's important to involve your parents in this conversation as well, so they can support and help make changes at home. Would you like me to provide you with some resources and guidance on child nutrition? Yes, please. I really want to help my sister get the nutrients she needs to grow and be healthy.

Nice to meet you, Akuji. How can I help you today? I need help with something. My family has been struggling with substance abuse for a while now. I'm sorry to hear that, Akuji. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? My older brother and my dad both drink a lot. It's affecting our family and making things really difficult at home. I can understand how challenging that must be for you. Have you talked to anyone about this issue before? No, I haven't. I didn't know who to turn to for help. You did the right thing by reaching out to us. It's important to talk about these things. Is there anyone else in your family who is aware of the situation? My mom knows about it, but she doesn't really do anything to stop them. She says they're functional addicts and that they can handle it. It's good that your mom is aware, but it's important for your family to address the issue and seek help. Substance abuse can have serious consequences. Have you noticed any changes in your family dynamics because of this? Yes, things have been really tense at home. My brother and dad get into arguments a lot, and my mom and I feel like we're walking on eggshells all the time. I'm sorry to hear that, Akuji.

I'm concerned about gender-based violence and discrimination that Eliza is facing at home. She is constantly being told by her parents that she can't do certain things because she is a girl. They also prioritize her brother over her when it comes to education and opportunities. I'm so sorry to hear that Eliza is going through this. Gender-based violence and discrimination are serious issues that need to be addressed. It's important for children to feel valued and treated equally regardless of their gender. Yes, exactly. I want to make sure that Eliza gets the support she needs to overcome these challenges and feel empowered. We can definitely help with that. It's important for Eliza to know that she deserves to be treated with respect and have the same opportunities as her brother. We can provide her with counseling and support services to help her navigate through this difficult situation. That would be great. Thank you so much for your help, Radhi.

I guess I've been scared they might make fun of me even more. But, maybe I should try and have a conversation with them. That sounds like a good idea, Mkuu. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own feelings and well-being over trying to please others. You deserve to be respected and supported by your friends. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any other concerns you have? Thank you, Constantine. I feel better after talking to you.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian Child Helpline. This is Collins speaking, how can I assist you today? Hi, my name is Sina and I'm calling about a child named Barke. He's 7 years old and he lives in Uyui, Tabora. I'm really concerned about him. What seems to be the issue with Barke, Sina? Well, recently I've noticed that he's been hanging out with some older kids in the neighborhood who are not the best influence. They've been pressuring him to skip school and cheat on his exams. I'm worried that he's getting involved in risky behavior because of peer pressure. That does sound concerning, Sina. It's important to address these issues early on to prevent any further negative impact on Barke's life. Have you talked to him about the dangers of cheating and skipping school? Yes, I have tried to talk to him about it, but he seems to be influenced by his friends more than he listens to me. I don't know what else to do to help him. I understand your frustration, Sina. It's important to continue having open and honest conversations with Barke about the consequences of his actions. If you feel comfortable, you can also involve his teachers and school authorities to address the academic dishonesty. Thank you for the advice, Collins. I will try to have another conversation with Barke and involve his school as well. I just want what's best for him. That's great to hear, Sina. Remember, you can always reach out to us at the Tanzanian Child Helpline for further support and guidance. Our phone number is +255 6967 895982.

Hello Fidelis, my name is Mariamu, and I'm here to help you. What seems to be the problem? I've been feeling really pressured by my friends to do things that I know are wrong. They want me to do risky things like kissing girls and touching them inappropriately. I'm sorry to hear that, Fidelis. It's important to remember that you should never do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Peer pressure can be tough, but it's crucial to stand up for what you believe in. I know, but I'm scared that if I don't go along with what they want, they won't be my friends anymore. It's understandable to feel that way, but true friends will respect your boundaries and values. It's essential to surround yourself with people who support and uplift you, not pressure you into doing things you're not comfortable with. I don't want to get into trouble or do something that could harm me. What should I do? You're right to be concerned, Fidelis. It's crucial to talk to a trusted adult about what's been happening. They can help guide you on how to handle peer pressure and risky behavior. You can also reach out to us at the Child Helpline whenever you need support or advice. Thank you, Mariamu.

She's 11 years old and experiencing some difficulties at home. I'm sorry to hear that, Natalia. Can you tell me more about what's going on with Alfajiri? Well, she's been witnessing a lot of violence between her parents. Her father has been physically abusing her mother, and Alfajiri has been very scared and upset about it. That sounds like a very distressing situation for Alfajiri to be in. It's important that she feels safe and supported. Have you noticed any changes in her behavior or mood because of the violence? Yes, she seems very withdrawn and scared all the time. She used to be a happy and outgoing child, but now she's always on edge. I understand. It's crucial that Alfajiri gets the help and support she needs. Is there anyone else in her life that she trusts and can confide in about the violence at home? I think she trusts her teacher at school, but I'm not sure if she's shared what's happening with her there. I just want to make sure she's safe and protected from the violence.

Hey Glory, it's okay to feel that way sometimes. Can you tell me more about what's been making you feel anxious and stressed? Well, I get really nervous when I have to talk to new people or when I have to do presentations in front of my class. I start sweating and my heart races really fast. I'm sorry to hear that you're going through that, Glory. It sounds like you might be experiencing social anxiety. Have you tried talking to anyone about how you're feeling? No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I didn't know who to turn to. It's great that you reached out to us today, Glory. It's important to talk about your feelings and not keep them bottled up inside. Have you tried any relaxation techniques when you start feeling anxious? Not really. I usually just try to avoid situations that make me feel anxious. Avoiding situations might provide temporary relief, but it's important to learn how to cope with your anxiety in a healthy way. Have you thought about talking to a school counselor or a trusted adult about how you've been feeling? I haven't, but I think I might try talking to my teacher about it.

It's understandable that Andwele may be feeling overwhelmed. First relationships can be quite challenging. Can you tell me more about what specifically is troubling him? Andwele is struggling with communication issues with his girlfriend. They often misunderstand each other and end up arguing. He doesn't know how to express his feelings and fears that he might lose her if things don't improve. It sounds like Andwele could benefit from learning healthy communication skills in relationships. It's important for him to express his feelings openly and honestly with his girlfriend. Have you talked to him about seeking advice or guidance on how to improve their communication? Yes, I have, but Andwele is quite shy and finds it hard to open up to others. He's afraid of being judged or rejected. I just want to help him navigate through this difficult time.

Is there a landmark near your location, like the Police Station, where Rach can go for assistance? Yes, there is a Police Station nearby. I will make sure to guide Rach there so she can get the help she needs. Thank you for your support, Zakia. You're welcome, Valentine.

I'm facing some issues and I need someone to talk to. Of course, Neema. I'm here to listen. What's been going on? Well, I've been experiencing gender discrimination at home and at school. My parents always prioritize my brothers over me, even when it comes to education. They say that boys are more important and should get better opportunities. I'm sorry to hear that, Neema. Gender discrimination is a serious issue. It's important for you to know that you deserve the same opportunities and rights as your brothers. Have you tried talking to your parents about how you feel? Yes, I've tried talking to them, but they just dismiss my concerns. They say that it's tradition and that I should accept my role as a girl. It's not fair for you to be treated differently just because of your gender. Have you thought about seeking help from someone outside of your family, like a teacher or a trusted adult? I haven't really thought about that, but I feel like I need to do something about it. I want to stand up for myself and make a change. That's a brave decision, Neema. Remember that you have the right to be treated equally and with respect. If you ever feel unsafe or need support, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you through this difficult time. Thank you, Ajabu. I feel better after talking to you. I will try to seek help and make a change in my situation. I'm glad that I could help, Neema.

Nice to meet you, Restituta. What's on your mind today? I've been feeling really lonely lately. I live in a small village, and there aren't many kids my age to play with. It's just me and my younger brother most of the time. I'm sorry to hear that, Restituta. Loneliness can be tough. Have you tried talking to your brother about how you're feeling? Yeah, but he's younger than me, so he doesn't really understand. I just wish I had friends my own age to hang out with. I understand. It must be hard feeling isolated like that. Is there anyone else in your village that you can talk to? Not really. Most of the other kids are older or younger than me, so I don't have much in common with them. I see. It sounds like you're feeling pretty isolated. Have you talked to your parents about how you're feeling? I've tried, but they're always busy with work and taking care of my brother. I don't want to bother them with my problems. It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, Restituta. It's okay to reach out for help when you're feeling lonely. Have you thought about joining any clubs or activities in your village to meet new friends? I haven't really thought about that. Maybe I could see if there are any clubs or groups I could join.

I have to cook for myself and I'm not really sure what I'm doing. That sounds really tough, Nen. It's important for parents to make sure their children are safe and taken care of.

What's on your mind today? I've been having some trouble with my friends at school. We used to be really close, but lately, they've been excluding me from things and leaving me out. I'm sorry to hear that, Suzana. Friendship issues can be really tough to deal with. Have you tried talking to your friends about how you feel? I tried, but they just brush it off and say everything is fine. I feel like they don't care about me anymore. That sounds really hurtful. It's important to remember that you deserve friends who treat you with kindness and respect. Have you thought about talking to a teacher or school counselor about what's been happening? I haven't, but maybe that's a good idea. I just feel so lonely and left out all the time. It's okay to feel that way, Suzana. Remember, it's not your fault if your friends are behaving in a hurtful manner. You deserve to be surrounded by people who value and appreciate you for who you are. Thank you, Elina. I feel a bit better talking about it. I think I will talk to a teacher tomorrow and see if they can help me. I'm glad to hear that, Suzana. Remember, you can always call us at the child helpline if you need someone to talk to. You're not alone in this. Thank you for listening, Elina. It means a lot to me. You're welcome, Suzana.

I also feel very tired all the time, no matter how much I rest. That sounds concerning, Adelina. Have you seen a doctor about these symptoms? No, I haven't been able to. My family doesn't have much money, and we live far from the nearest health center. The only way to get there is by crossing the river bridge, and it's been flooded due to the heavy rains. I understand the challenges you are facing, Adelina. It must be difficult to not have access to proper healthcare. Have you tried any home remedies or talked to anyone in your community about your symptoms? Yes, I have tried some traditional remedies, but they haven't helped much. I haven't talked to anyone in my community because I'm worried they might not take me seriously. It's important to take your health concerns seriously, Adelina.

Can you please tell me more about what's been happening with Joseph's education? Yes, Joseph has been denied his right to education by his parents. They believe that he should drop out of school and start working to support the family.

Every child has the right to education, regardless of their family's circumstances. Have you tried talking to Joseph's parents about the importance of education? Yes, I have tried to reason with them, but they are adamant about their decision. I fear that Joseph's future is at stake if this continues. I understand your concern, Feruzi.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian child helpline. This is Modesta speaking, how can I help you today? Hi Modesta, my name is Filbert. I'm a 13-year-old boy from Unguja Kaskazini A, Kaskazini Unguja. I'm really struggling with peer pressure and risky behavior. I'm sorry to hear that, Filbert. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? Well, lately my friends have been pressuring me to skip school and hang out with them instead. They keep pushing me to do things that I know are wrong, like stealing and vandalizing property. I don't want to get in trouble, but I also don't want to lose my friends. It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted, Filbert. It's important to remember that true friends wouldn't push you to do things that could harm you or others. Have you tried talking to your friends about how you feel? I've tried, but they just laugh it off and say I'm being too uptight. I feel like I'm being left out if I don't go along with what they want to do. It's tough to feel like you're on the outside, but it's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety. Have you thought about talking to a trusted adult about what's been going on? I haven't, but I think I might talk to my teacher about it. I don't want to get in trouble, and I want to make better choices for myself. That sounds like a good idea, Filbert. Remember, you can always reach out to us here at the child helpline if you need support or advice. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today? No, I think that's all for now.

Well, my parents have really high expectations for me when it comes to my grades. They always want me to be at the top of my class and it's putting a lot of pressure on me.

It's understandable to feel that way, Ruth. Have you tried talking to your parents about how you're feeling? I've tried, but they just tell me to work harder and that I should be able to handle the pressure. I just don't know what to do anymore. It sounds like you're really struggling with this academic pressure. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and take breaks when you need to. Your mental health is just as important as your grades.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian child helpline. This is Marwa speaking, how can I help you today? Hi Marwa, my name is Aailyah. I'm a 10-year-old girl from Kati Unguja, Kusini Unguja. I've been feeling really anxious and stressed lately. I'm sorry to hear that, Aailyah. Can you tell me more about what's been making you feel this way? Well, I have this really bad separation anxiety whenever my mom leaves for work. I start worrying about what might happen to her and I can't focus on anything else. That sounds really tough, Aailyah. It's normal to feel worried when someone you love is away. Have you talked to your mom about how you're feeling? Yes, I have. She always reassures me that she'll be okay and that she'll come back home soon. But I still can't shake off this feeling of anxiety. It's great that you're able to talk to your mom about your feelings. Have you tried any calming techniques when you start feeling anxious? Not really. What kind of techniques can I try? You can try deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques to help calm your mind when you start feeling anxious. You can also try distracting yourself with activities you enjoy, like drawing or playing with friends. That sounds like a good idea, Marwa. I'll try those techniques next time I start feeling anxious. Thank you for listening and for your advice. You're welcome, Aailyah. Remember, you can always call us at the child helpline if you need someone to talk to. Our phone number is +255 7808 939589.

I'm calling because I feel like I'm being neglected when it comes to my education. I'm sorry to hear that, Wasaki. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? Well, my parents don't seem to care about my education. They never ask about how school is going or if I need any help with my studies. They're always too busy with their own things to even notice me. That must be really tough for you, Wasaki. Have you tried talking to them about how you feel? I've tried, but they just brush it off and tell me to focus on my own studies. But how can I focus when I feel like no one is there to support me? I understand how frustrating that must be. Education is so important, and it's not fair that you feel like you're not getting the support you need. Have you talked to any teachers or other adults about this? No, I haven't.

Well, my friend has been approached by someone promising her a job in the city. They said she could make a lot of money and have a better life. That sounds like a common tactic used by human traffickers to deceive their victims. It's important that we take action to protect your friend. Have you talked to her about this? Yes, I tried to warn her about the dangers of falling for these promises, but she doesn't believe me. She thinks it's a great opportunity for her to escape poverty.

I'm sorry to hear that, Ipyana. Peer pressure can be really tough to deal with. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? Well, my friends keep telling me that everyone else is cheating, so I should too. They say it's the only way to get good grades. I understand how difficult that must be for you. It's important to remember that cheating is not the right way to succeed in school. Have you talked to anyone at school about this issue? No, I'm too scared to tell my teachers or my parents.

{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling the Tanzanian child helpline. This is Noelia speaking, how can I assist you today? Hi Noelia, my name is John and I'm calling about a child named Veronica. She's 13 years old and from Kasulu, Kigoma. Hello John, thank you for providing that information. What seems to be the issue with Veronica? She's been having some friendship issues lately. It seems like her social group has changed and she's feeling left out. I'm sorry to hear that. It must be tough for Veronica to navigate through those changes. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? Well, Veronica used to be really close with a group of girls from her school. They would hang out together all the time. But recently, they've started excluding her and forming new cliques without her. That sounds like a challenging situation for Veronica. Have you talked to her about how she's feeling? Yes, she's been feeling really lonely and sad about it. She doesn't understand why her friends are treating her this way. It's important for Veronica to know that she's not alone in this. It's common for friendships to change as we grow older. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help her cope with this situation and maybe even make new friends. That would be really helpful. Veronica is a kind and caring girl, she doesn't deserve to feel this way. I just want to see her happy again. I understand your concern for Veronica, John. Let's work together to come up with some strategies to support her through this difficult time. Maybe we can encourage her to explore new activities or clubs where she can meet new people. And remind her that true friends will always stand by her side, no matter what. Thank you, Noelia. I really appreciate your help and support. I will talk to Veronica and suggest some of these ideas to her. You're welcome, John. Remember, the child helpline is always here for you and Veronica whenever you need us. Take care and keep us updated on how she's doing. Thank you, Noelia. Goodbye.

They were talking about getting new clothes and phones too. It just didn't sound right to me. I'm glad you trusted your instincts, Linda.

Let's start by identifying the areas where you are having trouble. Have you discussed these issues with your teachers? They may be able to offer additional resources or tutoring to help you catch up. I haven't really talked to my teachers about it, Bora. I guess I was afraid they would think I'm not smart enough. But now that I mention it, there is a teacher named Mwanga at the Secondary School near my home who I trust and get along well with. I could talk to him about my concerns. That's a great first step, Busu! Speaking to your trusted teacher can help you understand the subjects better and develop a plan to improve your grades. It also shows that you are proactive in addressing your challenges. I appreciate your advice, Bora.", "entities": [{"start": 66, "end": 70, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 76, "end": 93, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 109, "end": 111, "label": "AGE"}, {"start": 121, "end": 124, "label": "GENDER"}, {"start": 299, "end": 303, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 397, "end": 414, "label": "INCIDENT_TYPE"}, {"start": 580, "end": 584, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1182, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1326, "label": "LANDMARK"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1447, "label": "NAME"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1667, "label": "NAME"}]}
{"text": "Hello, is this the child helpline? Yes, you've reached the right place. I'm Adla here to help. What seems to be the problem today? I'm Queen, a 12-year-old girl from Iramba, Singida. My family... things have been getting worse at home. There's domestic violence and my father is becoming more aggressive every day. I don't feel safe anymore. Oh dear, I'm really sorry to hear that Queen. It's very important for you to know that what you're experiencing isn't your fault. I can see how difficult this must be for you. Can you tell me more about the situation at home? Is there a specific incident that stands out? Yes, Adla. Last night, he came back drunk and started arguing with my mother. He raised his hand towards her and I tried to intervene. He pushed me away angrily. I'm scared for both of us. I'm really concerned about your safety, Queen. Have you considered reaching out to a trusted adult or authority figure? A teacher, school counselor, or even a local police officer could provide assistance. Is there someone like that in your life? There is a teacher at my school who I trust, but I've been too scared to tell her about this. I don't want my father to find out and retaliate against me or my mother. What should I do, Adla? It takes courage to seek help, Queen. I would encourage you to talk to your trusted teacher as soon as possible. If it feels too risky to discuss in person, consider writing a letter detailing what's been happening at home and giving it to her. Remember, there are people who care about your wellbeing and want to help.

He says I should learn to be responsible, but I don't understand why I have to suffer for that. I'm really scared, John. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and helpless. Can you help me?

I didn't mean any harm, and I don't know who else is doing it, but I'm worried about the consequences. I understand your situation, Hadithi.

It sounds like a lot for anyone to handle. Can you tell me more about what's causing you the most stress? Is there something specific that's been bothering you lately? Well, it's mostly schoolwork and family issues. I have a lot of assignments and exams coming up soon, and my family's financial situation is quite difficult right now. We live near Main Road, where it's always noisy and busy, which doesn't help with my concentration or mood. That sounds very challenging Albina.

I've tried talking to my mom and sister, but they don't seem to understand what I'm going through. They tell me to just try harder and not complain, but it feels like there's no end in sight. It's not uncommon for people to feel misunderstood by those closest to them Albina. It may help to talk to someone who can offer professional support, like a school counselor or therapist.

I'm a 15-year-old boy and I'm calling because my older brother is physically abusing me. I'm truly sorry to hear that, Sarki. Have you told anyone about this? A parent or a teacher perhaps? No, I haven't. My parents work abroad, and the only person here is my brother. He says it's because he's older, but it hurts so much. I can understand how difficult that must be for you, Sarki. It's never right for someone to hurt another person, especially a family member. Have there been any instances where other people have witnessed his behavior? Yes, once our neighbor saw him hitting me when he was angry about something I did. But he warned my brother not to tell anyone. That sounds incredibly stressful and scary for you. It's important to remember that it's never your fault when someone else hurts you. Have you considered talking to the neighbor again, or perhaps reaching out to a trusted adult at school? I think I might ask our neighbor again, but I don't know who to talk to at school. Some of my friends are aware of what's happening, but they don't know how to help. That sounds challenging. If you feel comfortable, could you speak with one of your friends about finding an adult at school who can help? This could be a teacher or the school principal.
