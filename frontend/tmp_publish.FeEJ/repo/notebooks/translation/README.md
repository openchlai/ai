- Training data preparation and augmentation

### model_evaluation/
- BLEU score calculation
- ROUGE metrics evaluation
- Translation quality assessment
- Human evaluation frameworks

### inference_pipeline/
- Real-time translation services
- Batch translation processing
- API integration for translation
- Translation confidence scoring

### multilingual_support/
- Language-specific processing
