## Voice AI Specific Best Practices

### 1. **Audio Data Handling**
- Store audio files in appropriate formats (WAV, FLAC for quality, MP3 for compression)

- Use consistent audio preprocessing across all experiments
- Keep original and processed audio versions separate

### 2. **Multi-language Support**
- Organize notebooks by language when working with multilingual data
- Document language-specific preprocessing steps
- Use consistent language codes (ISO 639-1/639-3)
- Test models across different languages and accents

### 3. **Model Pipeline Organization**
- Chain models logically: Audio → Transcription → Translation → NER → Classification → Summarization → Insights
- Use consistent data formats between pipeline stages
- Implement robust error handling for each stage
- Document expected input/output formats

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
- Track Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) for transcription
- Monitor BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR scores for translation
- Use F1, precision, and recall for NER and classification
- Implement real-time performance monitoring

### 5. **Data Privacy and Ethics**
- Anonymize personal information in voice data
- Implement proper data handling for sensitive content
- Document data usage and retention policies
- Consider bias in voice recognition across demographics

### 6. **Naming Convention**
