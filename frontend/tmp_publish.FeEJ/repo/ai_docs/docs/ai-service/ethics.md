# AI Ethics

Our AI is designed with a strong ethical framework to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.

## Bias Mitigation

We have implemented a multi-faceted approach to bias mitigation:

- **Diverse Training Data:** Our AI is trained on a diverse dataset to minimize demographic bias.
- **Regular Audits:** We conduct regular audits of our AI to identify and address any potential biases.
- **Fairness Metrics:** We use a variety of fairness metrics to evaluate the performance of our AI and ensure that it is not making biased decisions.

## Transparency

We are committed to transparency in our AI systems:

- **Model Cards:** We provide detailed model cards that explain how our AI models work.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** We use XAI techniques to make our AI's decisions more interpretable and understandable.
- **Public Disclosures:** We publicly disclose the use of AI in our services and provide clear explanations of its capabilities and limitations.
