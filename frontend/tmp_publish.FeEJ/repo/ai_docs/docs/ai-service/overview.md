# AI Service Overview

OPENCHS integrates **state-of-the-art AI services** to transform how child helplines operate — turning every conversation into **accurate, structured, and actionable case data** while dramatically reducing the administrative burden on caseworkers.

Our design philosophy blends **AI-powered automation** with **human-centered practice**, ensuring that:
- No call is lost  
- No survivor is left unsupported  
- Every decision is backed by **real-time, data-driven insights**

---

## The End-to-End AI Workflow

The OPENCHS AI pipeline operates from the **moment a call is received** to the **moment actionable intelligence reaches decision-makers**. Below is the sequence of AI-powered steps, alongside the direct **human impact** at each stage.

---

### **1. Call Reception & Transcription**
**AI Step:** Speech-to-Text (STT) using *Whisper*  
- Handles multiple languages and accents in real time  
- Produces time-stamped transcripts for indexing and search  

**Optional Step:** *Automatic Translation* (via *NLLB*)  
- Converts transcripts into the caseworker’s preferred language  

**Human Impact:**  
*"Language and accent barriers no longer block urgent help. Every word is captured and understood."*

---

### **2. Entity Extraction**
**AI Step:** Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- Identifies and tags **names, genders, dates, institutions, locations, contact details**, and other structured information  
- Flags sensitive PII for secure handling  

**Human Impact:**  
*"Key facts are ready the moment the caseworker opens the record — no manual retyping, no details missed."*

---

### **3. Classification**
**AI Step:** Automatic categorization of the case  
- Classifies **case type, intervention needed, risk level, referral type**, and other metadata  
- Uses domain-specific classification models trained on real helpline data  

**Human Impact:**  
*"From chaos to clarity: AI organizes information instantly so workers can focus on care, not coding data."*

---

### **4. Summarization**
**AI Step:** Condensed case summary generation  
- Extracts the **core narrative** of the call  
- Highlights **critical events, needs, and risk factors**  
- Reduces multi-minute conversations to a **readable, high-accuracy brief**  

**Human Impact:**  
*"Caseworkers spend less than half the time on documentation, freeing them to support more survivors."*

---

### **5. Insight Generation**
**AI Step:** Risk and intervention intelligence  
- Combines **classification, entity data, and summaries**  
- Suggests **risk scores, priority levels, potential interventions, and referral pathways**  

**Human Impact:**  
*"No more dropped referrals or missed follow-ups — high-risk cases get urgent attention automatically."*

---

### **6. Data Science & Decision Support**
**AI Step:** Aggregated and anonymized analysis  
- Generates **dashboards, performance metrics, and policy briefs**  
- Detects **emerging trends** and supports **predictive risk modeling**  

**Human Impact:**  
*"Frontline teams see daily trends; policymakers see national patterns — and both can act faster."*
