# Testing Strategy for Helpline & AI Service

This strategy is modeled after the **Testing Pyramid**, emphasizing a strong foundation of **unit tests**, supported by **integration** and **end-to-end tests**, ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of `helplinev1` and `ai_service`.

---

## 1. Static Analysis & Code Quality (The Foundation)

*Objective:* Enforce code style, catch syntax errors, and identify potential security vulnerabilities.

* **ai_service (Python)**
  - **Linting:** Ruff or Flake8 for PEP 8 compliance and logic errors.
  - **Type Checking:** MyPy to enforce static type hints.
  - **Security:** Bandit to scan for common vulnerabilities.
*Integration:* Pre-commit hooks and mandatory CI pipeline step.

---

## 2. Unit Testing

*Objective:* Verify individual components work correctly in isolation.

* **ai_service**
  - **Framework:** Pytest.
  - **Models:** Test model loading, preprocessing, prediction I/O contracts.
  - **API Routes:** Test endpoint logic, request validation, error handling (mock service layer).
  - **Services:** Test business logic, mocking external dependencies.
  - **Coverage:** Use pytest-cov, target >85%.

* **helplinev1**
  - Isolate core logic; mock `ai_service` calls during unit tests.

---

## 3. Integration Testing

*Objective:* Ensure different components or services work together as expected.

* **Intra-Service (ai_service):**
  - Test flow from API endpoint → service layer → (mocked) model.
  - Use Docker to run tests against service in container.

* **Inter-Service (helplinev1 ↔ ai_service):**
  - Verify communication and correct handling of responses.
  - Use docker-compose to spin up both services in isolated network.

---

## 4. Contract Testing

*Objective:* Prevent breaking changes between services.

* **Method:**
  1. helplinev1 generates a contract file (requests & expected responses).
  2. Share with ai_service.
  3. ai_service CI verifies API adheres to contract.
* **Tool:** Pact.

---

## 5. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*Objective:* Validate the entire workflow from start to finish.

* **Scenarios:**
  - User call initiated in helplinev1 → audio streamed to ai_service → transcription → summarization → final summary stored and displayed correctly.
  - User queries in helplinev1 retrieve data processed by ai_service.
* **Tools:** Pytest + requests, Playwright, or Cypress (if UI).

---

## 6. Performance & Security Testing

* **Performance Testing:**
  - **Objective:** Ensure ai_service handles expected load within acceptable limits.
  - **Tools:** Locust, k6.
  - **Types:** Load, Stress, Soak Testing.

* **Security Testing:**
  - **Objective:** Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
  - **Tools & Techniques:**
    - Dependency Scanning: pip-audit, Snyk, Dependabot.
    - DAST: OWASP ZAP.
