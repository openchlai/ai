## 1. INTRODUCTION

The OpenCHSai was conceived as a collaborative effort between BITZ IT Consulting Ltd and the Governments of Kenya and Uganda to improve the responsiveness, accuracy, and integrity of child welfare interventions. In leveraging advanced artificial intelligence capabilities such as speech recognition, multilingual natural language processing and predictive case triaging, this tool holds the potential to significantly strengthen frontline child protection services in Kenya, Uganda and across the region.

However, BITZ recognizes that the very technologies that enable progress also introduce risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, families in crisis, and marginalized communities. These risks may include data breaches, algorithmic bias, or privacy violations, each of which could undermine the public’s trust and the tool’s effectiveness.

This policy has therefore been developed to serve a dual purpose: to ensure strict compliance with applicable data protection laws and international standards, and to embed ethical safeguards that anticipate and address emerging challenges in the use of AI for social services.

The document provides a comprehensive framework for how BITZ collects, processes, secures, shares, and deletes sensitive personal data in accordance with regional legal requirements and global best practices. It also introduces a set of ethical principles that reinforce BITZ’s responsibility to act in the best interests of children, respect the autonomy of data subjects, and ensure that any harm, intentional or accidental, is mitigated swiftly and transparently.

By articulating these commitments clearly, BITZ aims to foster a shared understanding among stakeholders, including governments, service providers, civil society organizations, and the communities they serve, about how data is responsibly handled in the collective pursuit of child safety and protection.

## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Data Security and Privacy Protection Policy outlines the ethical, legal, and technical commitments of BITZ IT Consulting Ltd in its role as the Data Processor for OpenCHSai, an AI-powered child abuse reporting tool, developed in partnership with the Governments of Kenya and Uganda. The tool is designed to enhance child welfare outcomes by enabling timely, accurate, and secure reporting of child protection concerns, while upholding the highest standards in data handling and human rights.

The policy affirms BITZ’s responsibilities under Kenya’s Data Protection Act (2019), Uganda’s Data Protection and Privacy Act (2019), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and HIPAA-aligned best practices. It also acknowledges the unique vulnerabilities of children and reflects international child safeguarding principles through both its operational and ethical frameworks.

:::tip Key components of the policy include:

*   A Data Governance Framework that clearly delineates the roles and responsibilities of Data Controllers (the respective governments), BITZ (Data Processor), and any third-party vendors, supported by the appointment of a qualified Data Protection Officer (DPO).
*   Privacy-by-design mechanisms such as data minimization, informed consent protocols, encryption, pseudonymization, and rigorous access controls across technical, physical, and organizational domains.
*   Clearly defined procedures for data collection, processing, quality control, retention, and disposal, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and accountability throughout the data lifecycle.
*   AI-specific governance, including fairness audits, explainability protocols, human-in-the-loop decision making, and bias mitigation strategies to protect against discrimination and unwarranted automated decisions.
*   A robust incident response framework requiring breach notification within 24 hours and clear cooperation mandates with regulatory authorities.
*   Commitments to ongoing training, audit, policy review, and community engagement to ensure continued effectiveness, legal alignment, and trust-building with stakeholders.

**4. Risk Assessment**

Identify risks to rights and freedoms of data subjects in terms of impact and likelihood:

| Risk | Risk Type | Likelihood | Impact | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Re-identification from metadata | Privacy | Medium | High | Location + timestamps might re-link to identity |
| Bias in case prioritization for minorities | Algorithmic discrimination | Medium | High | Uneven risk scores due to training data imbalance |
| Unauthorized staff access | Security | Low | Medium | Role-based access might not be sufficiently granular |
| Poor understanding of AI triage decisions | Transparency | High | Medium | End users may not understand model outputs |

**5. Mitigation Measures**

Describe technical and organizational safeguards for each identified risk:

| Risk | Safeguards Implemented | Responsible Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Re-identification from metadata | Geofencing, pseudonymization, deletion after 90 days | Security Lead |
| Bias in prioritization | Diverse training dataset, fairness audits, human-in-the-loop for overrides | AI Governance Team |
| Unauthorized staff access | Tiered RBAC, annual access audits, anomaly detection | IT Administrator |
| Transparency of AI decisions | Risk score explanations, model cards, override logs | Product Lead |

**6. Children’s Rights Impact Lens**

*   Does the system act in the **best interests of the child**?
*   Is the tool **age-appropriate**, empowering, and respectful?
*   Might it unintentionally stigmatize or expose vulnerable youth?
*   Has consideration been given to **equity across gender, geography, or disability**?

**7. Consultation Summary**

Record input from DPO, stakeholders, or regulators

*   **DPO Review Date**:
*   **Consulted Parties**: Internal ethics teams, external experts, Data Controllers, civil society, front-line service workers, others.
*   Summary of feedback received and how it was incorporated into design and safeguards.
