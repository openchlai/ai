# AI-Powered Voice Processing & Case Prediction

This project is an advanced AI-driven solution for voice processing and case prediction. It enables automated transcription, translation, and case classification to enhance efficiency in call management systems.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Converts speech to text using AI-driven speech-to-text models.
- **Translation**: Translates transcribed text into English to support multilingual users.
- **NLP-Based Case Prediction**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify cases and predict outcomes.
- **Workflow Automation**: Automates processing using Celery and other orchestration tools.
- **Data Storage & Visualization**: Stores processed data in MinIO/S3 and provides visual analytics.

## AI Trainer
We use an **AI Trainer** to fine-tune our models for transcription, translation, and case prediction.

## ✅ Quality Assurance (QA) Process

This project follows an open-source QA process across all major components:

- **Frontend (Vue 3)**: Tested using `vitest` and `vue/test-utils`.
- **Backend (PHP)**: Tested using `PHPUnit`.
- **AI Services (Python)**: Tested using `pytest` and `unittest`.
- **JS Utilities**: Tested using `mocha` and `chai`.

See [`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md) and [`docs/Unit_Testing_Guide_Vue_Django.md`](./docs/Unit_Testing_Guide_Vue_Django.md) for setup instructions.

Test automation and CI integration is handled via GitHub Actions.

We maintain user stories and test cases in `docs/stakeholders/user_stories/`.

AI and data science decisions are documented in:
- [`DATA_PIPELINE.md`](./DATA_PIPELINE.md)
- [`models/`](./models/)
- [`ai_service/README.md`](./ai_service/README.md)
