# Roadmap
Our project roadmap outlines the key milestones and planned features for the future development of our system. It aims to address various aspects, including shift management, business intelligence, and the implementation of an open API. The roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and evolving requirements. Here are the major milestones:

- **Phase 1: Foundation and Core Functionality**

    - Develop the core functionality of the system, including helpline call management, case management, and data collection for violence against children and gender-based violence.
    - Implement shift management features to efficiently manage helpline staff schedules and ensure continuous coverage.
    - Establish a secure and scalable infrastructure to support the system's growth.

- **Phase 2: Enhancing User Experience and Business Intelligence**

    - Improve the user experience by incorporating user feedback and conducting usability testing.
    - Enhance the reporting capabilities to provide comprehensive business intelligence insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.
    - Implement advanced analytics features to identify trends, patterns, and key performance indicators.

- **Phase 3: Integration and Interoperability**

    - Develop an open API that enables seamless integration with other child protection systems, including the MHHPS, to promote data sharing and collaboration.
    - Explore integration possibilities with third-party systems and services to extend the functionality and value of our system.
    - Ensure compatibility and compliance with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

- **Phase 4: Customization and Scalability**

    - Provide customization options to cater to specific organizational requirements and workflows.
    - Scale the system to handle increased user load and growing data volumes while maintaining optimal performance.
    - Continuously optimize and fine-tune the system based on user feedback and emerging technologies.
    
- **Phase 5: Community Engagement and Continuous Improvement**

Foster an active user community by organizing webinars, conferences, and knowledge sharing sessions.
Regularly update the system with new features, bug fixes, and security enhancements based on user feedback and emerging industry standards.
Collaborate with stakeholders, partners, and the open-source community to drive innovation and address evolving needs in the child protection domain.
Please note that this roadmap is a high-level overview and may be subject to adjustments based on changing priorities, emerging technologies, and user feedback. We are committed to delivering a robust, user-friendly, and impactful system that contributes to the well-being and safety of vulnerable children and victims of gender-based violence.
