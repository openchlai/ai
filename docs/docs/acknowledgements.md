    We would like to express our gratitude to the following open-source projects and libraries that have contributed to the success of our system:

    - [SIP.js](https://sipjs.com/): SIP.js is a powerful JavaScript library that provides a simple and intuitive way to implement Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) communication in web applications. It has been instrumental in enabling voice communication features within our system.

    - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): Chart.js is a versatile JavaScript library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs. It has greatly facilitated the implementation of data visualization features in our system, enabling users to gain valuable insights from their data.

    - [SimpleXLSXGen](https://github.com/shuchkin/simplexlsxgen): SimpleXLSXGen is a lightweight PHP library for generating Excel files. We have leveraged this library to provide support for exporting and importing data in Excel format, enhancing the data management capabilities of our system.

    We extend our appreciation to the developers and contributors of these projects for their hard work, dedication, and the open-source spirit that powers their creations. Without their valuable contributions, our system would not have been as feature-rich and efficient as it is.

    We also want to acknowledge the broader open-source community for their continuous support and inspiration. The collaborative nature of open source has played a significant role in shaping and advancing our project.

    If you find our system useful, we encourage you to explore and contribute to these projects as well, helping to foster the growth and improvement of the open-source ecosystem.

    Please note that the mentioned projects and libraries may have their own licenses and terms of use. We recommend reviewing their respective documentation for more information.

    If you have any questions or need further information regarding the acknowledgments or the usage of these projects in our system, please refer to the Support section or contact the project maintainers listed in the Authors section.
