# Features
Our project offers a range of features to support helplines in East Africa in addressing violence against children (VAC) and gender-based violence (GBV). These features include:

- **Contact Center & Call Management:**  Efficiently manage incoming calls, track call details, and ensure prompt response and resolution for reported cases of VAC and GBV. The system provides a centralized platform for helplines to handle and monitor calls effectively.

- **Case Management:** Seamlessly capture, organize, and manage case information related to VAC and GBV. Our system enables helplines to create, update, and track cases, ensuring a comprehensive view of each case's status, history, and associated actions.

- **Quality Assurance:** Implement quality assurance measures to maintain high service standards and adherence to established protocols. The system supports monitoring and evaluation processes, enabling helplines to ensure consistent and effective support for victims of violence.

- **Pivot Reports and Dashboards:** Generate insightful reports and visual dashboards to analyze trends, identify patterns, and gain actionable insights into VAC and GBV data. The system offers flexible reporting capabilities, allowing helplines to customize and drill down into the data based on their specific needs.

- **Customization:** Tailor the system to meet the unique requirements and workflows of different helplines. Our project provides customization options, allowing helplines to configure the system according to their specific operational processes, data collection needs, and reporting preferences.

- **3rd Party Integrations:** Seamlessly integrate with other child protection systems and tools, including the [Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)](https://emergency.unhcr.org/emergency-assistance/health-and-nutrition/mental-health-and-psychosocial-support-mhpss) platform. Our system facilitates data sharing, collaboration, and interoperability, enabling helplines to connect with relevant stakeholders and leverage existing resources more effectively.

    These features collectively empower helplines in East Africa to streamline their operations, enhance data-driven decision-making, and improve their response to cases of violence against children and gender-based violence. The integration with other child protection systems further strengthens the collaboration and holistic approach in addressing the well-being of children and victims.

    For detailed instructions on how to utilize each feature, please refer to the Documentation section. Contributions to further enhance or customize these features are welcome as outlined in the Contributing section.

    Feel free to explore and leverage these features, including the 3rd party integrations, to effectively manage and address incidents of violence in your region.
