# AI-Powered Voice Processing & Case Prediction

This project is an advanced AI-driven solution for voice processing and case prediction. It enables automated transcription, translation, and case classification to enhance efficiency in call management systems.

##  Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts speech to text using AI-driven speech-to-text models.
- **Translation**: Translates transcribed text into English to support multilingual users.
- **NLP-Based Case Prediction**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify cases and predict outcomes.
- **Workflow Automation**: Automates processing using Celery and other orchestration tools.
- **Data Storage & Visualization**: Stores processed data in MinIO/S3 and provides visual analytics.
