## The Child Helpline Case Management
Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for helplines in East Africa, specifically addressing the critical issue of Violence Against Children (VAC) and Gender-Based Violence (GBV). By utilizing our system, helplines can efficiently collect, store, and analyze data related to these pressing societal concerns.

With our system, helplines can effectively track and document incidents of violence, ensuring that crucial information is securely stored and easily accessible. By centralizing and organizing this data, our system enables helplines to gain valuable insights into the prevalence, patterns, and trends of VAC and GBV in the region.

Through advanced data analysis techniques, our system empowers helplines to identify key risk factors, inform evidence-based interventions, and ultimately contribute to more targeted and impactful efforts in combating violence against children and gender-based violence. By offering a comprehensive and user-friendly platform, our project aims to strengthen the capacity of helplines in East Africa and enhance their ability to protect and support vulnerable individuals.

Overall, our project serves as a vital tool in the fight against Violence Against Children and Gender-Based Violence, empowering helplines in East Africa to make informed decisions, drive positive change, and ultimately work towards creating safer and more inclusive communities.
