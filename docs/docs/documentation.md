# Additional Resources
In addition to the project's documentation and features, we provide several additional resources to support your usage and understanding of the system:

Access the user manual [here](\public\files\The-Helpline-User-Manual.pdf) to gain a deeper understanding of the system's functionalities and maximize its potential.

- **API Documentation for MHPPS Integration:** If you're looking to integrate our system with the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPPS) platform, we have dedicated API documentation available. This documentation outlines the endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and data exchange procedures for seamless integration. Explore the API documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21578213/2s83zdvkcH) to facilitate the integration process.

- **Presentation Slides:** To further understand the project's scope, features, and potential impact, we have prepared presentation slides that provide an overview of the system and its capabilities. Review the presentation slides [here](/training/OPENCHS-PITCHDECK.mp4) to gain insights and share the information with relevant stakeholders.

These additional resources will complement the project's documentation and assist you in effectively utilizing the system, integrating with MHPPS, and conveying its value to others.
