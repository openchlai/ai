# **Project Governance Structure Document**

**Project Name:** AI-Powered Call Management System

---

## **1\. Introduction**

This document establishes the governance framework for the AI-Powered Call Management System project. The purpose of this framework is to ensure alignment with strategic objectives, facilitate efficient decision-making processes, implement robust risk management strategies, and delineate clear lines of accountability throughout the project lifecycle, encompassing development, deployment, and operational phases.

## **2\. Governance Objectives**

| Objective | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Strategic Alignment | To guarantee the project's adherence to established business and operational objectives. |
| Decision-Making | To enable the punctual and judicious determination regarding development and artificial intelligence efficacy. |
| Accountability | To delineate explicit duties across the backend, frontend, artificial intelligence, and telephony departments. |
| Risk Management | To forensically recognize, diminish, and observe potential project hazards. |
| Adaptability | To assure the system's capacity for subsequent ameliorations and augmentation. |

## **3\. Governance Structure**

| Governance Level | Roles and Responsibilities | Composition |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Strategic Governance (Steering Committee)** | Establishes strategic direction, exercises high-level oversight, and grants approval for significant decisions. | Representatives from **UNICEF**, **BITZ ITC Leadership**, and key stakeholders from the nations of **Kenya**, **Tanzania**, **Uganda**, and **Lesotho** are included. |
| **Project Management Office (PMO)** | Manages project implementation, ensures adherence to project objectives, monitors risks, and coordinates interdepartmental teams. | The **Project Lead**, Nelson Adagi, **Product Owners**, and a designated **UNICEF Representative** constitute the membership. |
| **Technical Advisory Board** | Guarantees the application of open-source best practices, ethical principles in Artificial Intelligence, and observance of privacy and security protocols. | Members include **Ken Orwa** (Specialist in AI Ethics and Data Privacy), **Gateway Frankline** (AI Trainer S3), and **Joseph Kimani** (Expert in Backend and System Architecture). |

## **4\. Decision-Making Process**

| Decision Type | Owner | Approval Level | Escalation Point |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Operational | Project Manager | Project Manager | Steering Committee |
| Technical | Technical Lead, Advisory Board | Steering Committee | Project Sponsor |
| Major Changes | Steering Committee | Steering Committee Approval | Project Sponsor |
| Critical Issues | Steering Committee | Project Sponsor Approval | Not Applicable (N/A) |

## **5\. Risk Management**

| Risk Category | Potential Issues | Mitigation Strategy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Data Privacy | Instances of data breaches and regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). | Implementation of data anonymization techniques, stringent access controls, and regular compliance audits. |
| AI Model Risks | Model performance degradation, inaccurate predictive outputs, and the presence of bias. | Periodic model retraining, systematic bias detection, and continuous performance monitoring. |
| Operational Risks | System outages affecting call functionality, suboptimal voice processing, and system capacity overload. | Deployment of redundant fallback systems, automated scaling mechanisms, and establishment of manual override protocols. |
| Project Risks | Budgetary excesses, insufficient resource allocation, and project schedule delays. | Conduct of frequent progress evaluations and formulation of contingency response plans. |
