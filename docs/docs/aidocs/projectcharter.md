# **Project Charter**

## **1. Project Title**  
**AI-Driven Call Management & Case Triage System**  

## **2. Project Sponsor**  
**UNICEF Venture Fund**  

## **3. Project Manager**  
Nelson Adagi, BITZ IT   

## **4. Mission & Vision**  

### **Vision**  
*"To develop innovative, impactful solutions that address global societal challenges, empower communities, and foster a more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future for all."*  

### **Mission**  
*"To create transformative solutions that tackle societal challenges, drive change, and shape a better future for communities worldwide."*  

## **5. Project Purpose & Justification**  
Bitz ITC is a **software development company** currently developing an **AI and ML-powered Open Source call management system** to support call centers assisting survivors of **gender-based violence (GBV) and violence against children (VAC)**.  

### **Results to Date**  
The system has been **deployed and scaled in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Lesotho** in English. A **prototype** with expected enhancements and functionalities is under development, using an AI model trained on **non-identifiable data gathered over the last five years**.  

### **Investment Rationale**  
Bitz ITC has been **working with UNICEF in five ESAR Country Offices (CO) and the Regional Office (RO)**. With their **expertise in data management systems**, they are well positioned to generate **AI-powered analytics** based on past trends. According to UNICEF's **Regional Office**, **regional language translation** is key to expansion in new countries.  

## **6. Work Plan & Project Objectives**  
During the investment period, Bitz ITC will focus on:  
- **Developing AI algorithms** for **translation and voice recognition** to support rollout in new countries.  
- **Creating AI-driven analytics** to extract insights from captured case data.  
- **Refining NLP-based case triage models** to improve case classification and risk prediction.  
- **Enhancing open-source accessibility** for scalability and adoption by call centers globally.  

## **7. Project Scope**  
### **In-Scope:**  
- **AI-powered transcription, translation, and case classification**.  
- **Case triage automation** based on severity and risk.  
- **Data processing and workflow automation** to improve response times.  
- **Open-source accessibility** for adoption by other organizations.  

### **Out-of-Scope:**  
- Direct case handling or intervention.  
- Development of proprietary AI models (only open-source models will be used).  
- Non-digital case management processes.
