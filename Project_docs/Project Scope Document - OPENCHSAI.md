**Project Name:** AI and ML-Powered Open Source Call Management System  
 **Company:** Bitz ITC  
 **Project Sponsor:** UNICEF Venture Fund  
 **Project Manager:** Mr. Nelson Adagi

## **1\. Project Overview**

Bitz ITC, a pioneering technology firm, is spearheading the development of an open-source call management system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to revolutionize the operations of call centers dedicated to assisting survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and violence against children (VAC).

The system's advanced AI capabilities encompass a range of functionalities designed to streamline and enhance the call handling process. Voice processing and transcription enable the accurate capture and documentation of caller interactions, while language translation ensures effective communication across linguistic barriers. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms play a crucial role in predicting case types and severities, allowing for efficient case triage and prioritization. Additionally, workflow automation streamlines routine tasks, freeing up human agents to focus on providing essential support and empathy to callers in distress.

By integrating these AI-driven features, the call management system aims to significantly improve the operational efficiency of GBV and VAC support call centers. The system's data-driven insights enable call center staff to make informed decisions promptly, ensuring that survivors receive the timely and appropriate assistance they need. Moreover, the open-source nature of the project fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing, facilitating the widespread adoption and adaptation of the system to meet the specific needs of different communities and organizations.

The Bitz ITC initiative has garnered support from the UNICEF Venture Fund, a testament to its potential to create a lasting impact in the fight against GBV and VAC. The system is currently being deployed across several African countries, marking a significant step forward in leveraging technology to address these critical social issues. The project's potential for scalability and adaptability holds promise for its expansion to other regions and contexts, ultimately contributing to a more effective and coordinated global response to GBV and VAC.
