# Milestone 7: Privacy & Security - Development and Refinement of Policies

This document outlines the activities undertaken for Milestone 7, focusing on the development and refinement of privacy and security policies.

## Activity 1: Develop documents and/or privacy agreements to include privacy-specific language in the Terms of Use, vendor contracts, user consent notice, and any other agreement that may be applicable.

**Description:** This activity involves the creation or modification of various legal and operational documents to ensure comprehensive inclusion of privacy-specific language. The goal is to clearly articulate data handling practices, user rights, and compliance measures across all relevant agreements. This includes, but is not limited to:
- **Terms of Use:** Integrating clauses that detail data collection, usage, sharing, and user consent mechanisms.
- **Vendor Contracts:** Ensuring that all third-party agreements include robust data protection clauses, data processing addendums (DPAs), and clear responsibilities regarding data privacy and security.
- **User Consent Notices:** Designing clear, concise, and easily understandable consent notices that inform users about data practices and obtain explicit consent where required.
- **Other Applicable Agreements:** Reviewing and updating any other internal or external agreements that may involve the processing or sharing of personal data.

## Activity 2: Develop a privacy policy

**Description:** This activity focuses on the comprehensive development of a privacy policy. The privacy policy will serve as a transparent declaration to users about how their personal information is collected, used, stored, and protected. Key elements to be included are:
- **Data Collection:** What types of personal data are collected and the methods of collection.
- **Purpose of Processing:** Why the data is collected and how it will be utilized.
- **Data Sharing:** Under what circumstances data may be shared with third parties.
- **User Rights:** Information on users' rights regarding their data (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, portability).
- **Security Measures:** The safeguards in place to protect personal data from unauthorized access or breaches.
- **Contact Information:** How users can contact the organization regarding privacy concerns.

## Activity 3: Develop a data retention policy

**Description:** This activity involves establishing a clear and compliant data retention policy. This policy will define the periods for which different categories of data are to be retained, the criteria for determining these periods, and the secure disposal methods once retention periods expire. The policy will consider:
- **Legal and Regulatory Requirements:** Compliance with relevant data protection laws and industry-specific regulations.
- **Business Needs:** Retention periods necessary for operational, financial, and analytical purposes.
- **Data Categorization:** Classifying data types to assign appropriate retention schedules.
- **Secure Disposal:** Procedures for the irreversible deletion or anonymization of data at the end of its retention lifecycle.
- **Documentation:** Maintaining records of data retention schedules and disposal actions.
